{"player_news": ["View:AllInjury News Only Sort By:DateTeam August 24 Stetson Bennett RamsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 2:10 PM Bennett will be the Rams' backup quarterback for the first two weeks of the regular season while Jimmy Garoppolo serves his suspension, Stu Jackson of the team's official site reports. Spin:Garoppolo was suspended two games for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances, opening the door for Bennett to serve as the backup to Matthew Stafford to open the regular season. Bennett played in the first two preseason games, but he was held out of the Rams' preseason finale against the Texans on Saturday, with Dresser Winn starting under center for the entire contest. In his last game against the Chargers on Aug. 17, Bennett completed 17 of 31 pass attempts for 213 yards, one touchdown and one interception. ", " Craig Reynolds LionsRB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:53 PM Head coach Dan Campbell said Saturday that Reynolds (leg) should be available for the Lions' regular-season opener against the Rams on Sept. 8, Colton Pouncy of The Athletic reports. Spin:Reynolds sustained a leg injury during Thursday's practice, which kept him out of Detroits' preseason finale against Pittsburgh on Saturday. He is competing against Sione Vaki for the No. 3 running back role behind Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. Reynolds accumulated 16 rushing yards on five carries over his two preseason appearances. ", " Russell Wilson SteelersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:44 PM Wilson completed both of his passes for 26 yards in Saturday's 24-17 preseason loss to the Lions. Spin:Wilson started for the second consecutive game but played only one drive that ended in a rushing touchdown. Both of his passes went to George Pickens, the latter being an explosive 32-yard gain. Per Brooke Pryor of ESPN.com, coach Mike Tomlin declined to name his starting quarterback for Week 1 against Atlanta, but it's expected that Wilson will get the nod. Even if that's the case, Wilson will likely need to play well to maintain the role over Justin Fields in the long term. ", " Chuba Hubbard PanthersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:43 PM Hubbard rushed three times for 15 yards and wasn't targeted in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Hubbard played the opening drive with Carolina's other starters, while Miles Sanders mixed in later with the backups, suggesting that Hubbard occupies the top spot on the depth chart heading into the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Saints. Rookie second-round pick Jonathon Brooks (knee) is expected to challenge for the starting job eventually, but Brooks isn't expected to be available until Week 3 at the earliest. ", " Diontae Johnson PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:42 PM Johnson caught one of two targets for 17 yards in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Johnson missed time during training camp due to a groin injury and illness, so it was nice to see him get into a preseason game and build some rapport with Bryce Young. Johnson's lone catch was an important one, as it helped the Panthers convert on fourth down on an opening drive that ended in a touchdown before Carolina's starters got the rest of the day off. The former Steelers wide receiver is expected to be the top pass catcher on his new team in the regular season, which begins Sept. 8 against the Saints. ", " Owen Wright RavensRB Doubtful News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:40 PM Wright is expected to undergo surgery for a hairline fracture in his foot that he sustained in Saturday's preseason game against the Packers, Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic reports. Spin:The injury isn't considered to be season ending, but Zrebiec notes that the Ravens will now have to make a decision on whether to retain Wright on the roster at the conclusion of training camp. Wright was a strong contender to win the No. 3 running back spot behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill, but now his spot on the Ravens' roster is in jeopardy. With Wright's injury and Keaton Mitchell (knee) still on the active/PUP list, the door has opened for Rasheen Ali and Chris Collier to compete for the third running back spot behind Henry and Hill as training camp winds down. ", " Bryce Young PanthersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:40 PM Young completed six of eight passes for 70 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Young was effective on his only drive in the game, converting a 4th-and-three with a 17-yard pass to Diontae Johnson before connecting with tight end Jordan Matthews for an eight-yard touchdown. Those are two of the offseason additions to a new-look Panthers passing game under new head coach Dave Canales. The Panthers are hoping these changes will help Young bounce back from an underwhelming rookie season in which he threw for only 2,877 yards and an 11:10 TD:INT. The 2023 first overall pick will look to begin his regular-season redemption arc Sept. 8 in New Orleans. ", " Anthony Schwartz DolphinsWR Doubtful News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:00 PM Schwartz suffered a ligament tear in his left knee during Friday's preseason loss to Tampa Bay, Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports. Spin:Schwartz didn't play in either of the Dolphins' first two exhibition contests but was finally able to take the field Friday for the preseason finale. The 23-year-old caught both of his targets for 24 yards, but on his second catch -- a 17-yard reception thrown by Skylar Thompson -- he hurt his knee while being tackled. Jackson cites a source in indicating that Schwartz tore a ligament in his left knee on the play and suggests that the speedy wideout is headed either to IR or toward an injury settlement. Miami has yet to confirm those details, but this nonetheless appears to be another hit to a wide-receiver room that has had its depth thinned due to a multitude of injuries. ", " Ihmir Smith-Marsette PanthersWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 12:49 PM Smith-Marsette is questionable to return to Saturday's preseason game against the Bills due to an ankle injury, Darin Gantt of the Panthers' official site reports. Spin:The wide receiver was examined for a possible lower right leg injury after landing awkwardly following a catch, per David Newton of ESPN. Smith-Marsette returned a punt for 21 yards and a kickoff for 46 yards before exiting. The 24-year-old is projected to be Carolina's punt returner in 2024. ", " Dak Prescott CowboysQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 12:36 PM Prescott is not in line to play in Saturday's preseason finale against the Chargers, Jon Machota of The Athletic reports. Spin:Per Machota, the plan is for Trey Lance to play the entire game, which would set the stage for both Prescott and Cooper Rush to be held out versus Los Angeles. Prescott's next game action is thus slated to occur on the road against Cleveland on Sept. 8. ", " Eddy Pineiro PanthersK Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 2:30 PM Pineiro told reporters that he did not return for the second half of Saturday's preseason game against the Bills due to mild hamstring soreness, Darin Gantt of the Panthers' official site reports. Spin:Pineiro relayed that he could have kicked in the second half if needed and said that the team wanted to \"err on the side of caution\" with the hamstring injury. He made both of his extra-point attempts and a 45-yard field goal in the first half of Saturday's contest. Pineiro should be good to go for the Panthers' regular season opener against the Saints on Sept. 8. ", " Derek Carr SaintsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 12:24 PM Carr is among a number of Saints starters who isn't likely to play in Sunday's preseason finale against Tennessee, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football reports. Spin:Carr suited up for each of New Orleans' first two preseason games and completed a combined nine of 15 pass attempts for 59 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. He's the clear No. 1 quarterback for the Saints heading into the season, so the team will use the final exhibition contest to assess Jake Haener and Spencer Rattler, each of whom is expected to play two quarters Sunday, per Underhill. Haener and Rattler are in close to a dead heat for the backup QB role to open the campaign, so how each performs against the Titans could determine the winner of that battle. ", " Darrynton Evans BillsRB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 11:56 AM Evans (hamstring) is out for the rest of Saturday's preseason game against the Panthers. Spin:The running back -- who is fighting for a roster spot -- carried the ball three times for 15 yards and caught two passes for 24 yards and a score before exiting. Evans signed with the Bills in January after spending 2023 with the Bears and Dolphins, carrying the ball 32 times for 121 yards and a score over seven regular-season games. ", " Jacob Harris EaglesWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 11:01 AM Harris has a concussion and is out for the rest of the Eagles' preseason game against the Vikings on Saturday. Spin:The wide receiver did not record a catch before exiting. Harris is competing for a depth role beyond Philadelphia's top trio of A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Jahan Dotson. The fourth-year pro has one catch for six yards in three previous NFL seasons. ", " Deshaun Watson BrownsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 10:42 AM Watson won't play in Saturday's preseason finale against the Seahawks, Kelsey Russo of the Browns' official site reports. Spin:Watson was able to participate in practice throughout the week leading up to the contest, but he was limited Wednesday due to what was described as general arm soreness. Though the signal caller returned to a full session Thursday, the Browns will play it safe with Watson, which sets the stage for his first game action since November of 2023 to occur Sept. 8 against the Cowboys. Per Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal, Jameis Winston is slated to draw the start at QB versus Seattle on Saturday. ", " Tommy Sweeney BearsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 10:41 AM Sweeney was released by the Bears on Saturday. Spin:The tight end was competing for a roster spot behind Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. Sweeney did not see the field in 2023 with the Giants after appearing in 24 games between 2019 and 2022 with the Bills. ", " Nsimba Webster BearsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 10:36 AM Webster (groin) was placed on injured reserve by the Bears on Saturday. Spin:The wide receiver will need to reach an injury settlement with the team to have a chance to play in 2024. Webster injured the groin during Thursday night's preseason win over the Chiefs. The 28-year-old has two catches for 14 yards in 29 career games. ", " Dylan Laube RaidersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 10:18 AM Laube rushed three times for 12 yards and added one catch on one target for six yards in Friday's preseason tie with the 49ers. He also lost a fumble and returned a kickoff for 24 yards. Spin:Las Vegas sat most of its starters in the contest, and Laube was thus handed the start. He ripped off a nice eight-yard run on his second carry but ended his day on a sour note, losing a fumble following a six-yard reception late in the first quarter. That Laube suited up Friday while Zamir White, Ameer Abdullah and Alexander Mattison all sat could be a hint about where he stands in the running back pecking order. He could see more work in the return game than as a ball carrier in his rookie campaign. ", " Jordan Love PackersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:55 AM Love is among the Packers' healthy key skill players not slated to see action in Saturday's preseason finale against the Ravens, Mike Spofford of the team's official site reports. Spin:Also in that category are RB Josh Jacobs, WRs Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks as well as TE Luke Musgrave. Love's next start will thus occur Sept. 6 against the Eagles. ", " Nico Collins TexansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:48 AM Collins is among a number of Texans wideouts not dressed for Saturday's preseason contest versus the Rams, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Also expected to be held out of the contest are Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell and Robert Woods. Those four are at the head of the wide receiver depth chart for the Texans, so the team appears to be have made the decision to keep its top players out of the exhibition finale. John Metchie III, Ben Skowronek, Xavier Hutchinson and Steven Sims, among others, will get a chance to shine as Houston's pass catchers Saturday. ", " Joe Mixon TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:45 AM Mixon is among the Texans' key players not in line to see action in Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Per Wilson, the same applies to QB C.J. Stroud, RBs Dameon Pierce and Dare Ogunbowale as well as WRs Stefon Diggs, Nico Collins, Tank Dell, Robert Woods. Come Week 1, Mixon is slated to lead the Texans' backfield against the Colts. ", " C.J. Beathard JaguarsQB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:40 AM Beathard (groin) didn't play in Friday's preseason win over Atlanta, John Oehser of the Jaguars' official site reports.. Spin:Beathard's absence from the contest was expected, as he suffered a groin injury during Jacksonville's second exhibition game last Saturday versus Tampa Bay and didn't practice all week. Trevor Lawrence started for the Jaguars on Friday and produced 92 yards through the air along with two touchdowns while completing eight of 10 pass attempts, and Mac Jones played the bulk of the game and looked good in completing 13 of 18 pass attempts for 113 yards and a touchdown. The performance may have given Jones a leg up in the battle with Beathard for the backup quarterback role behind Lawrence, though Jones and Beathard were said to be in a close competition for most of training camp. ", " C.J. Stroud TexansQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:35 AM Stroud is not in line to play in Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Per Wilson, fellow QBs Case Keenum and Tim Boyle are expected to play extensively Saturday as they compete for slotting behind Stroud and Davis Mills. Stroud's next game action is thus slated to occur Sept. 8 against the Colts, when he'll helm an offense that will feature a pass-catching corps led by WRs Stefon Diggs, Nico Collins and Tank Dell, along with TE Dalton Schultz. ", " Daniel Jones GiantsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:27 AM Most of the Giants' starters, including Jones, are expected to be held out of Saturday's preseason finale against the Jets, Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Jones also skipped New York's preseason opener against Detroit on Aug. 8, but he did suit up for the team's second exhibition contest last Saturday versus Houston, playing the entire first half and completing 11 of 18 passes for 138 yards and two interceptions while adding 12 yards on one carry on the ground. That (and the Giants' preseason joint practices with the Lions and Jets) appear to be enough to satisfy the team's brass in regard to Jones' readiness for the regular season despite the fact that the QB didn't play after Week 9 last year due to a torn ACL. Jones will also be working with a number of different pieces on offense this season -- Darren Waller retired and Saquon Barkley departed to Philadelphia while New York drafted dynamic wideout Malk Nabers with the sixth overall pick in April's NFL Draft. ", " Jared Goff LionsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:13 AM Goff isn't likely to see action in Saturday's preseason finale against the Steelers, Tim Twentyman of the Lions' official site reports. Spin:Goff was held out of the team's first two exhibition contests, and it looks like the Lions will continue to play it safe with their top QB on Saturday. As a result, look for Hendon Hooker, who's competing with Nate Sudfeld for backup slotting behind Goff, to draw the start against Pittsburgh. In that scenario, Goff's next game action will occur Sept. 8 against the Rams. ", " Tommy Tremble PanthersTE Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:11 AM Tremble (hamstring) isn't in line to play in Saturday's preseason finale against Buffalo, Darin Gantt of the Panthers' official site reports. Spin:Carolina is playing most of its starters in the contest, but Tremble is being held out due to continued management of a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old will thus miss the entire preseason slate, though there hasn't been any indication that he won't be ready to suit up for Week 1 of the regular season. Fellow tight end Ian Thomas has a calf injury and is also sitting out Saturday, so fourth-round rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders figures to work with the starters. ", " Ricky Pearsall 49ersWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:39 AM Coach Kyle Shanahan indicated after Friday's preseason finale that he hopes Pearsall (shoulder) will be able to practice this coming week, Jeremy Bergman of NFL.com reports. Spin:When asked if he thought Pearsall -- who was unavailable for the contest -- would be ready for Week 1 action, Shanahan said \"I hope so...We'll see how he is this week. Hoping he gets into practice this week, and if he does, that's a pretty good sign that he could be available for then.\" The report adds that Shanahan told reporters Friday that Pearsall is dealing with a subluxation (or partial dislocation) of his shoulder, which stems from the wideout's time in college. It's an issue that left Pearsall's shoulder feeling \"tender\" after a recent aggravation of the issue. The 2024 first-rounder's status gains added import for the 49ers ahead of the regular season, considering the uncertainty surrounding fellow WR Brandon Aiyuk, whose contract situation with the team remains unresolved. ", " Trey Lance CowboysQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:21 AM Lance might play the entirety of Saturday's preseason finale against the Chargers, Nick Harris of DallasCowboys.com report s. Spin:Owner/GM Jerry Jones has stated outright that Lance is locked into a spot on the 53-man roster, but the coaching staff is still trying to figure out what to do with him. The 24-year-old quarterback has had a solid preseason statistically, completing 40 of 64 passes for 339 yards and a touchdown while adding 78 rushing yards and another TD on 13 carries, but his decision-making and ability to read defenses remains erratic. Dak Prescott is the unquestioned starter for Dallas, but Lance could still be in consideration for the No. 2 spot over Cooper Rush depending on his performance Saturday. ", " Rakim Jarrett BuccaneersWR Doubtful News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:21 AM Coach Todd Bowles acknowledged this weekend that Jarrett (undisclosed) is likely to begin the coming campaign on IR, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. Spin:With roster cutdowns looming, it looks like Jarrett's unspecified injury will cost him time out of the gate this season. In his anticipated absence, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Jalen McMillan and Trey Palmer are projected to lead the Bucs' WR corps heading into Week 1. ", " Chase Edmonds BuccaneersRB Doubtful News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:15 AM Coach Todd Bowles indicated this weekend that Edmonds (undisclosed) is likely to begin the coming season on IR, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. Spin:Edmonds has been sidelined with an unspecified injury that has lingered, and it looks like he'll begin the 2024 campaign on IR, a scenario that would see him miss at least four games out of the gate. In his looming absence, Rachaad White, Bucky Irvingand Sean Tucker profile as Tampa Bay's top backfield options ahead of Week 1. ", " Cameron Latu 49ersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:14 AM Latu had three receptions on as many targets for 42 yards in Friday's preseason finale against Las Vegas. Spin:Latu appeared in all three of San Francisco's exhibition contests this preseason, finishing with eight receptions (10 targets) for 84 yards. Despite the tight end's healthy debut this offseason, the front office still signed veteran Logan Thomas to enter the mix for snaps behind George Kittle this upcoming campaign. Latu possesses more fantasy upside than the team's other TE backups, but it sounds like the 2023 third-round selection will have to truly earn his way onto the club this season. ", " Isaac Guerendo 49ersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 12:47 AM Guerendo (hamstring) rushed 11 times for 32 yards and caught both of his targets for three yards in Friday's preseason tilt against Las Vegas. Spin:Guerendo returned from a hamstring injury that cost the fourth-round pick two games of action this exhibition season. The Louisville product didn't post gaudy rushing numbers in his 49ers debut, but he had an electric kickoff return of 93 yards that fell just short of paydirt. Guerendo currently sits behind veteran backups Elijah Mitchell and Jordan Mason on the depth chart, but the 6-foot, 221-pound rookie has the physical tools to profile as a fantasy prospect should he survive the impending roster cuts ahead the Sept. 27 deadline. August 23 Nathan Peterman RaidersQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:43 PM Peterman completed 12 of 19 pass attempts for 108 yards and a touchdown in Friday's preseason finale against the 49ers. Spin:Peterman was signed to the Raiders earlier this preseason after getting cut loose by the Saints on Aug. 2. The veteran journeyman rejoins Las Vegas for the second time in his pro career in an attempt to back up journeyman starter Gardner Minshew this upcoming season. Peterman would still have to beat out the current frontrunner for the No. 2 position, Aidan O'Connell, who was one of the healthy scratches in Friday's exhibition. ", " Jordan Mason 49ersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:32 PM Mason (hip) took eight carries for 42 yards and a touchdown in Friday's preseason finale against the Raiders. Spin:Mason returned from a minor hip issue that cost him the 49ers' previous preseason game. The 25-year-old started the contest with Christian McCaffrey (calf) and Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) sitting out with minor injuries. This is the second strong showing from Mason this preseason, as the veteran backup continues to build a case to challenge Mitchell's status at No. 2 on the RB depth chart. This will be McCaffrey's show once the regular season kicks off, but Mason is a name to remember in the event the starter is unable to go at any point this year. ", " George Kittle 49ersTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:17 PM Kittle had three receptions on four targets for 34 yards in Friday's preseason finale against the Raiders. Spin:Kittle sat out the 49ers' first two exhibitions as the team eased him back into action after going under the knife this past offseason. The star tight end looked like his usual self post-surgery, leaping over a stretched out defender at one point of the preseason tilt in order to make an impressive grab across the middle. Kittle's effort in Friday's exhibition confirms the physical tight end's health as San Francisco prepares to host the Jets on the first installment Monday Night Football of the 2024 season on Sept. 9. ", " Deebo Samuel Sr. 49ersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:02 PM Samuel corralled two of three targets for 32 yards in Friday's preseason tie with the Raiders. Spin:Samuel did not have a rushing attempt in Friday's exhibition, seeing action over the team's first three drives before exiting with the rest of the starters. Fellow wideout Brandon Aiyuk remained out of uniform due to continued contract negotiations that have dominated the offseason headlines in San Francisco. Samuel's role is unlikely to change even if Aiyuk gets moved, giving fantasy managers confidence in the former's productivity come Week 1. ", " Brock Purdy 49ersQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 10:47 PM Purdy completed nine of 12 pass attempts for 96 yards and one interception in Friday's preseason finale against the Raiders. Spin:Purdy had a better go of things in his second preseason tilt after going completing just two of six attempts against the Saints in last week's exhibition. The 24-year-old wound up completing three drives Friday before an interception off of a tipped pass ended the starter's final exhibition appearance of 2024. Preseason results rarely matter for proven starters in the NFL, so fantasy managers should focus on Purdy's stellar 4,280/31/11 passing line from his breakout 2023 campaign, given his good health and favorable fantasy situation heading into Week 1. ", " Malik Washington DolphinsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 9:21 PM Washington caught his only target for seven yards and rushed once for 40 yards, while adding a 45-yard kickoff return and a 28-yard punt return in Friday's 24-14 preseason loss to the Buccaneers. Spin:Washington has proven capable of making plays in a variety of situations with the ball in his hands throughout the preseason. The rookie sixth-round pick probably won't see consistent playing time at wide receiver, but his versatility should help him secure a roster spot, and Miami's coaching staff may continue to scheme the ball into Washington's hands on gadget plays or in special-teams situations after the regular season kicks off Sept. 8 against the Jaguars. ", " Jeff Wilson Jr. DolphinsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 9:07 PM Wilson rushed four times for minus-1 yard and caught two of three targets for 21 yards in Friday's 24-14 preseason loss to the Buccaneers. Spin:It was revealed during the game that Wilson broke his nose earlier in August, per Alain Poupart of Sports Illustrated, which explains his absence from Miami's second preseason game. Wilson didn't do much in this preseason finale, but he scored a touchdown in the preseason opener against the Falcons. Miami will definitely keep Raheem Mostert, De'Von Achane and rookie fourth-round pick Jaylen Wright on the roster at running back, so Wilson's at risk of being a surprise cut prior to the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Jaguars. ", " Jaylen Wright DolphinsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:56 PM Wright (undisclosed) rushed seven times for 36 yards and caught four of six targets for 41 yards in Friday's 24-14 preseason loss to the Buccaneers. Spin:Wright was held out of the previous preseason game against the Commanders due to an undisclosed injury, but the rookie fourth-round pick's sizable workload Friday suggests he's back to full health. He's the latest speedster to join a Dolphins backfield led by Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane, but Wright could struggle to earn playing time early in his career while those other two running backs are healthy. Wright will get a chance to make his NFL regular-season debut Sept. 8 against the Jaguars. ", " Cade Otton BuccaneersTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:50 PM Otton started Friday's 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins but wasn't targeted. Spin:Otton played only the first drive along with the rest of the first-team offense. The Buccaneers went with three wide receivers, one running back and one tight end throughout the drive, showcasing the personnel grouping that Tampa Bay will likely use the majority of the time come the regular season, which kicks off Sept. 8 against the Commanders. That heavy reliance on 11 personnel stems in part from the lack of quality tight-end options on the roster behind Otton, who exceeded a 90-percent snap share in every regular-season game last year. ", " Chris Godwin BuccaneersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:42 PM Godwin caught his only target for nine yards in Friday's 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins. Spin:Tampa Bay's starting offense (sans the resting Mike Evans) played the opening drive, and Godwin caught one of Baker Mayfield's three completions. Godwin has topped 1,000 receiving yards in four of the past five regular seasons, and the 28-year-old wide receiver is expected to play a key role in the passing attack once again when the games start to count Sept. 8 against the Commanders. ", " Baker Mayfield BuccaneersQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:39 PM Mayfield completed all three of his pass attempts for 54 yards in Friday's 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins. Spin:Mayfield was in midseason form for his only drive of the preseason. He notched consecutive completions of nine yards to Chris Godwin, 17 yards to Rachaad White and 28 yards to Jalen McMillan before White ran in a four-yard touchdown to cap the first-team offense's brief stint in the game. Mayfield's coming off a successful first season in Tampa Bay, as he posted his first 4,000-yard passing campaign in the regular season and won a playoff game. The 29-year-old quarterback looks ready to pick up where he left off when the Buccaneers kick off the regular season Sept. 8 against the Commanders. ", " Jase McClellan FalconsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:20 PM McClellan rushed the ball four times for 12 yards in Friday's 31-0 preseason loss to the Jaguars. He added one reception on one target for 11 yards. Spin:McClellan followed Carlos Washington into the game with both Tyler Allgeier and Bijan Robinson resting. He has flashed some ability throughout the preseason, particularly in last week's matchup against the Ravens when he totaled 55 yards on the ground. That appears to be enough to have McClellan fourth on the depth chart, putting him on the roster bubble heading into cutdown day. ", " Erik Ezukanma DolphinsWR Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:15 PM Ezukanma (foot) is week-to-week according to Miami head coach Mike McDaniel, David Furones of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. Spin:Ezukanma didn't play in Friday's preseason finale against Tampa Bay and was wearing a walking boot before the contest. He has been on the roster bubble throughout training camp, so the issue could hurt his chance of making the squad. The 2022 fourth-round draft pick played sparingly in his first two NFL campaigns, totaling one catch on two targets for three yards along with five rushes for 22 yards over 38 offensive snaps across three games. ", " Odell Beckham Jr. DolphinsWR Out News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:09 PM Coach Mike McDaniel said after Friday's preseason loss at Tampa Bay that the Dolphins hope Beckham (undisclosed) will be able to practice before Week 1, Joe Schad of The Palm Beach Post reports. Spin:After signing a one-year deal with Miami in May, Beckham spent the entirety of training camp and exhibition season on the active/PUP list due to an unknown injury. Considering McDaniel's comment Friday, the team could make it clear that Beckham is closing in on full health by removing him from PUP, but he ultimately won't be able to join his teammates in drills until such a move is made. ", " Trey Palmer BuccaneersWR Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:02 PM Coach Todd Bowles said Palmer (undisclosed) is tending to a minor injury, Greg Auman of Fox Sports reports. Spin:After suiting up for both of the Buccaneers' first two preseason games, Palmer sat out Friday's exhibition win against the Dolphins, even though starters not named WR Mike Evans were available. Palmer now is among three of the team's wide receivers dealing with undisclosed health concerns -- also, Sterling Shepard and Rakim Jarrett -- so he'll use the time before Week 1 to get back to 100 percent. Rookie third-rounder Jalen McMillan appears to be the leader in the clubhouse for the No. 3 at the position behind Evans and Chris Godwin, and Palmer's current issue may solidify that thinking further. ", " Parker Washington JaguarsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:00 PM Washington recorded four catches on five targets for 35 yards in Friday's 31-0 preseason win over the Falcons. Spin:Washington got the chance to play with Jacksonville's starting unit with Christian Kirk (calf) sidelined. He tallied a pair of receptions from Trevor Lawrence and then remained in the game for a few additional drives as Jacksonville's backups took the field. That's indicative of Washington's status on the depth chart, as he should operate as the fourth wide receiver when Kirk, Gabe Davis and Brian Thomas are all healthy. ", " Gabe Davis JaguarsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 7:53 PM Davis was unable to record a catch on either of his targets in Friday's 31-0 preseason win over the Falcons. Spin:Davis was on the field with Trevor Lawrence and the majority of Jacksonville's starting unit for two drives. He was blanked on the stat sheet but was targeted in the end zone on the latter of the starting unit's possessions. Davis has a clear grasp on a starting role as an outside receiver heading into a Week 1 matchup against Miami. ", " Brian Thomas Jr. JaguarsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 7:45 PM Thomas brought in his only target for 38 yards in Friday's 31-0 preseason win over Atlanta. Spin:Thomas played on a pair of offensive drives, both of which came with Trevor Lawrence. Though he was targeted only once, Thomas did showcase his big-play ability while making a long catch before turning up the field to pick up an additional 20 yards. He has seemingly cemented himself as a starting outside receiver opposite Gabe Davis with Christian Kirk operating primarily out of the slot heading into a Week 1 matchup against Miami. ", " Evan Engram JaguarsTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 7:35 PM Engram brought in all four of his targets for 28 yards and two touchdowns in Friday's 31-0 preseason win over the Falcons. Spin:Engram played on two drives, both of which came with Trevor Lawrence. With Christian Kirk (calf) sidelined, Engram was Lawrence's favorite target and caught touchdown receptions of five and six yards. He has failed to top four trips to the end zone in the regular season since his rookie campaign in 2017, but this usage could suggest he'll be a favorite target in the red zone in 2024. ", " Travis Etienne Jr. JaguarsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 7:23 PM Etienne rushed the ball seven times for 46 yards in Friday's 31-0 preseason win over Atlanta. He added one reception on one target for three yards. Spin:Etienne and the majority of the Jaguars' starters took the field for two drives and experienced plenty of success. More interesting than the stat line was Etienne's usage, as he tallied seven carries to Tank Bigsby's three on the opening two possessions. Bigsby came on the field for a pair of short-yardage situations -- he was stuffed on the first -- but Etienne handled the vast majority of the workload. Jacksonville's coaching staff has discussed the desire to lighten Etienne's usage in 2024, but he'll be the clear lead back and could shoulder a very significant workload until Bigsby proves he can have success in the NFL. ", " Elijah Mitchell 49ersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 6:30 PM Mitchell isn't in line to play in Friday's preseason game in Las Vegas, Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Spin:A strained hamstring sidelined Mitchell for the first two exhibitions, and even though he returned to practice Wednesday, the 49ers will opt to keep him in street clothes two days later. He'll thus turn his focus to Week 1, when he's expected to serve as the primary backup to All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey (calf). In 27 regular-season games in his three-year career, Mitchell has averaged 4.7 YPC while scoring 10 total touchdowns. ", " Tua Tagovailoa DolphinsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 4:06 PM Tagovailoa isn't slated to play in Friday's preseason game at Tampa Bay, David Furones of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. Spin:Tagovailoa thus will end this year's exhibition slate with one appearance last Saturday against the Commanders in which he completed all five of his passes for 51 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. Once Week 1 rolls around, the biggest question marks for the Dolphins offense will be the health of WRs Tyreek Hill (hand) and Jaylen Waddle (undisclosed), neither of whom took part in the preseason. In two campaigns working with coach Mike McDaniel, Tagovailoa has completed 67.4 percent of his passes, averaged 272.4 passing yards per game and put together a 54:22 TD:INT in 30 regular-season contests. ", " Mike Evans BuccaneersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 3:12 PM Evans isn't in line to play in Friday's preseason finale against the Dolphins, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. Spin:Per Smith, coach Todd Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network that neither Evans nor LB Lavonte David will face Miami in the team's final exhibition contest. However, the duo's absence is not injury-related, rather it's a case of them getting the night off, like a 'veteran' day in practice. Evans' next game action will thus occur when he lines up in Tampa Bay's starting lineup against the Commanders in a Week 1 matchup on Sept. 8. ", " Josh Reynolds BroncosWR Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 1:36 PM Coach Sean Payton indicated that Reynolds has some \"wear and tear\" with an Achilles, but noted that the wideout felt better Friday, Parker Gabriel of The Denver Post reports. Spin:Payton added that Reynolds, who worked on a side field Friday, should be fine, but we suspect that the team will err on the side of caution and hold the 29-year-old out of Sunday's preseason finale against the Cardinals. As Week 1 approaches, Reynolds is looking to cement a key role in a Denver WR corps that's led by Courtland Sutton and also includes Tim Patrick, Marvin Mims, Troy Franklin and Devaughn Vele. ", " Zay Jones CardinalsWR Suspended News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 12:54 PM Jones has been suspended for the first five games of the season for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy, Darren Urban of the Cardinals' official site reports. Spin:Per Josh Weinfuss of ESPN, Jones -- whose suspension stems from an arrest Nov. 13 -- will be eligible for reinstatement Oct. 7 following the Cardinals' Week 5 game against the 49ers. As a result, the soonest Jones will be able to see regular-season action is Oct. 13 against the Packers. With Jones slated to be unavailable out of the gate this season, Marvin Harrison, Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch are in line to head the team's WR corps beginning Sept. 8 against the Bills. ", " Kwamie Lassiter II FAWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 12:44 PM Lassiter was waived by Cincinnati on Friday, according to the Bengals' official site. Spin:Lassiter will be in search of a new squad after signing on with the Bengals in January. He'll be waived alongside fellow pass catcher Hakeem Butler, as the wide receiver room was packed this August. ", " Marcus Mariota CommandersQB Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:56 AM Mariota (groin) will miss Sunday's preseason finale against the Patriots but is trending toward fully practicing next week, Ben Standig of The Athletic reports. Spin:While the backup quarterback will miss his second preseason matchup in a row, he should be back to practice next week in preparation for Washington's season opener against the Bucs on Sept. 8. Although fellow Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels has been announced the starter ahead of the season, Mariota's health is still relevant considering he'll serve as the rookie second overall pick's primary backup to open 2024. ", " Mitchell Wilcox PatriotsTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:51 AM Wilcox (calf) was back at practice Friday, Doug Kyed of the Boston Herald reports. Spin:The tight end was out for five days after going down with a calf injury last Sunday during practice. While Wilcox is primed for a depth role this year, veteran tight ends Hunter Henry (undisclosed) and Austin Hooper (undisclosed) are dealing with injuries of their own. This could at least open up opportunities for Wilcox if he's able to play this Sunday when the Patriots finish out the preseason against the Commanders. ", " Lucas Havrisik BrownsK News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 11:07 AM The Browns re-signed Havrisik on Friday, Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Spin:The kicker rejoins Cleveland just a day after the team traded Cade York to Washington. Havrisik appeared in nine games with the Rams last season, making 15 of 20 field-goal attempts and 19 of 22 extra-point tries. He'll assume the backup kicker spot to veteran Dustin Hopkins, but Hopkins' minor injury could open up some playing time for Havrisik. ", " Jelani Woods ColtsTE Doubtful News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 10:49 AM Woods reportedly underwent a procedure Friday to address a turf toe injury that's expected to sideline him about four months, according to Jordan Schultz of BleacherReport.com and James Boyd of The Athletic. Spin:If the initial estimate for his return is accurate, the tight end could return in time for the stretch run of the coming season. For any length of time that Woods is sidelined, Kylen Granson, Mo Alie-Cox, Drew Ogletree and Will Mallory are slated to handle the Colts' TE duties. ", " JaMycal Hasty PatriotsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 10:27 AM Hasty is making a push to secure a spot in the Patriots' backfield ahead of Week 1, Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports. Spin:While Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson are roster locks, Hasty and Kevin Harris could be competing for the team's No. 3 RB role. It's possible that the Patriots end up keeping four backs on their initial 53-man roster, but either way, the 5-foot-8, 205-pound Hasty remains in contention to secure a depth/change-of-pace role in the team's backfield. ", " Drake Maye PatriotsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 9:41 AM Maye is slated to play in Sunday's preseason finale against the Commanders, Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Coach Jerod Mayo revealed Friday that Jacoby Brissett would start the contest, with Maye, Bailey Zappe and Joe Milton also in line to see action versus Washington. Per Chad Graffof The Athletic the Patriots hope to decide on a Week 1 starting QB (between Brissett and Maye) by Monday night, but as the team's final exhibition game approaches, Mayo acknowledged that \"it's still a competition and Jacoby is still QB1.\" That said, on Sunday, Maye will have one more chance to make a case to overtake his veteran counterpart before the team's plans for a Sept. 8 matchup against the Bengals are solidified. ", " Jacoby Brissett PatriotsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 8:10 AM Coach Jerod Mayo said Friday that Brissett will start Sunday's preseason finale against Washington, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports. Spin:Brissett started the first two preseason games and completed three of 10 passes for 17 yards (with one interception) over the course of four unimpressive drives. Drake Maye has fared better coming off the bench and reportedly has a chance to get the nod Week 1, but Mayo and offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt both recently said they still view Brissett as their starting quarterback. The final preseason game gives Maye another opportunity to make an impression and potentially leapfrog Brissett before Week 1. ", " Trey Sermon ColtsRB Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 23, 6:52 AM Sermon (hamstring) didn't play in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:James Boyd of The Athletic expects Sermon to have a spot on the initial 53-man roster despite missing the final two preseason games and the past couple weeks of practice. The running back was injured during the first quarter of the Colts' preseason opener, after reports out of training camp pegged him as a favorite for the second spot on the depth chart. It's a role that doesn't figure to entail many touches when Jonathan Taylor is healthy, and there's some chance Sermon's absence will lead the Colts to turn to Evan Hull and/or Tyler Goodson instead. The team may even put Sermon on injured reserve if he won't be ready for Week 1, in which case he'd be ruled out for the first four games of the season. August 22 Anthony Gould ColtsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:32 PM Gould had four receptions for 25 yards on five targets in Thursday's preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:The 2024 fifth-round draft pick was seen mostly as a candidate for special teams as a star punt and kickoff returner, but had an impressive training camp and preseason that saw him get time with the first-team offense. He may have also won the kickoff return job and could take over the punt return job if Josh Downs misses regular season games due to a high ankle sprain. ", " Evan Hull ColtsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:26 PM Hull had nine carries for 30 yards but lost three yards on one reception in Thursday's preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Hull was the third running back to enter the game after Jonathan Taylor and Tyler Goodson, but also got time with the first-string offense. Goodson rushed 13 times for 57 yards and caught two of three targets for 10 yards, so the two backs competing for the No. 3 running back job had another similar preseason outing. Trey Sermon hurt his hamstring in the preseason opener, and if he still isn't ready to play by the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Texans, Goodson and Hull would likely split change-of-pace duties behind Taylor. ", " Ashton Dulin ColtsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:19 PM Dulin (hamstring) had one reception for 11 yards on four targets in Thursday's preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:While he didn't do much in the preseason game, he returned from a hamstring injury that had sidelined him the last two weeks. He looks ready for the start of the regular season where he'll be a key special teams player as a gunner and serve as the fourth or fifth receiver. ", " Jared Wiley ChiefsTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:02 PM Wiley secured one of two targets for three yards in the Chiefs' 34-21 preseason loss to the Bears on Thursday night. Spin:The rookie fourth-round pick finished off the preseason in quiet fashion, matching fellow reserve tight end Irv Smith's reception and yardage totals. Wiley and Smith could potentially both make the Chiefs' roster if the team decides to go four deep at the position. ", " Mecole Hardman ChiefsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:37 PM Hardman brought in his only target for six yards in the Chiefs' 34-21 preseason loss to the Bears on Thursday night. Spin:The Super Bowl hero played a minor role in the exhibition finale, and it remains to be seen if there will be room for Hardman on the Chiefs' initial 53-man roster. Hardman could be no better than the No. 7 receiver on the depth chart as it currently stands, even when factoring in Marquise Brown's shoulder injury. Hardman also offers value as a returner, but there are other candidates with similar skill sets in Kansas City's deep wideout room. ", " Kadarius Toney ChiefsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:25 PM Toney secured two of three targets for 26 yards and returned one punt for 16 yards in the Chiefs' 34-21 preseason loss to the Bears on Thursday night. Spin:Toney has had a quiet preseason partly due to a back injury, but he turned in a solid performance relative to opportunity Thursday. The 2021 first-round pick of the Giants is looking for a reset of sorts as he heads into his second full season in Kansas City, after suffering through an inconsistent and mistake-laden 2023 campaign that also saw him besieged by multiple injuries. Whether he's done enough to hold on to a roster spot remains to seen given the Chiefs' refurbishing of the receiving corps this offseason, but Marquise Brown's shoulder injury could buy Toney some early-season time in a best-case scenario. ", " Deneric Prince ChiefsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:17 PM Prince rushed three times for minus-1 yard and brought in his only target for three yards in the Chiefs' 34-21 preseason loss to the Bears on Thursday night. Spin:Prince saw both Carson Steele and Keaontay Ingram -- the latter his primary competition for a reserve running back spot -- fill larger roles in the preseason finale. Prince appeared in two regular-season games as an undrafted rookie in 2023, but it remains to be seen where he'll slot in on the depth chart come Week 1, with Isiah Pacheco and Clyde Edwards-Helaire also in the team's backfield mix. ", " Carson Steele ChiefsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:12 PM Steele rushed four times for 50 yards and a touchdown in the Chiefs' 34-21 preseason loss to the Bears on Thursday night. He also returned one kickoff for 29 yards. Spin:The undrafted UCLA product got a nice chunk of his team-high rushing yardage total on a 31-yard scamper, but he was impressively efficient overall with his few opportunities. Steele is listed as a fullback on the Chiefs' unofficial preseason depth chart, but he's looked good with the ball in his hands and has arguably made a case for a 53-man roster spot, especially with no other player listed at his position. Nevertheless, Kansas City's ground game will naturally be dominated by Isiah Pacheco come the regular season, with Clyde Edwards-Helaire (illness) and Deneric Prince likely also in the mix for complementary snaps. ", " Velus Jones Jr. BearsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:01 PM Jones rushed 13 times for 111 yards and a touchdown and secured both targets for 11 yards in the Bears' 34-21 preseason win over the Chiefs on Thursday night. Spin:Jones recorded a game-high yardage total on the ground with the help of a 39-yard scoring scamper, seeing his most extensive action as a running back yet this preseason. The converted wide receiver appears to have acclimated nearly seamlessly to the position change, but it's presently difficult to ascertain exactly how Jones may fit in a crowded running back room if he indeed makes the final roster. However, were one of Roschon Johnson or Khalil Herbert to be traded before the start of the regular season, Jones could make for an intriguing change-of-pace back alongside whichever of the two remains and lead back D'Andre Swift. ", " Tyler Scott BearsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:55 PM Scott secured six of nine targets for 99 yards, rushed once for 17 yards and returned two kickoffs for 49 yards in the Bears' 34-21 preseason win over the Chiefs on Thursday night. Spin:Scott took advantage of the expanded opportunity afforded by the fact the Bears' top three wideouts sat out, posting team-high reception, receiving yardage and target totals. The 2023 fourth-round pick still projects to open the season as no better than the No. 4 receiver behind DJ Moore, Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze, but his game-breaking speed will still make him an intriguing deep-league asset, especially if he also gets opportunities to work as a returner as he did Thursday. ", " D'Andre Swift BearsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:45 PM Swift didn't log any action in the Bears' 34-21 preseason win over the Chiefs on Thursday night. Spin:Swift unsurprisingly was held out of action along with the other Bears front-line players as well as some key reserves such as backfield mates Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson. Swift enjoyed his healthiest season yet in 2023 with the Eagles and parlayed it into his first 1,000-yard campaign, and he's expected to be a key asset to rookie first overall pick Caleb Williams as both an effective runner that will command opposing defenses' respect and as a trusted target out of the backfield. ", " Erick All Jr. BengalsTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:10 PM All caught his lone target for 10 yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason loss to the Colts. Spin:All also blocked well, as the rookie fourth-round pick got a chance to showcase his versatile skill set while the Bengals' top skill players got the night off. Having recovered from a torn ACL that he suffered in October at Iowa, All will almost certainly earn a spot on Cincinnati's 53-man roster, but the tight end's likely to begin his career in a depth role behind some combination of Mike Gesicki, Drew Sample and Tanner Hudson when the Bengals begin regular-season play Sept. 8 against the Patriots. ", " Jermaine Burton BengalsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:06 PM Burton caught four of five targets for 56 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's 27-14 preseason loss to the Colts. Spin:Burton failed to come down with a one-handed catch attempt down the sideline from Logan Woodside in the first quarter after his first catch went for no gain, but the rookie third-round draft pick racked up 35 yards in a three-play span in the third quarter before catching a 21-yard touchdown in the fourth to account for 56 of Woodside's 98 passing yards. Cincinnati didn't play its starters Thursday, so Burton's participation in the game is further evidence that he's behind Ja'Marr Chase (contract dispute), Tee Higgins and Andrei Iosivas on the wide receiver depth chart heading into the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Patriots. Burton scored two touchdowns in three preseason games, so it may be just a matter of time before he earns a larger role. ", " Tyler Goodson ColtsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:05 PM Goodson rushed 13 times for 57 yards and caught two of three targets for 10 yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Jonathan Taylor started the game, but Goodson was the second running back to mix into the game alongside the rest of the first-team offense, though Evan Hull (nine carries for 30 yards) also got some opportunities with the starters. Goodson continued to play with the backups, as the Colts wanted to get a long look at both him and Hull. Trey Sermon hurt his hamstring in the preseason opener, and if Sermon still isn't ready to play by the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Texans, Goodson and Hull would likely split change-of-pace duties behind Taylor. ", " Adonai Mitchell ColtsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:04 PM Mitchell caught two of four targets for 18 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Mitchell had a pair of nine-yard receptions on the opening drive, the second of which resulted in a touchdown over the middle from the slot. Anthony Richardson completed only one more pass across the starters' four other drives in the game, so Richardson was unable to build on his hot start. Mitchell's ability to line up outside or in the slot should earn the rookie second-round pick plenty of playing time out of the gate, especially with Josh Downs' (ankle) status uncertain for the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Texans. ", " Michael Pittman Jr. ColtsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:03 PM Pittman caught one of two targets for 12 yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Pittman's lone catch came on the first drive, but he couldn't get anything else going as Anthony Richardson went cold on the next few drives, and Pittman dropped his only other target. The Colts are likely to be more effective on the ground than through the air given Richardson's rushing ability and the presence of star running back Jonathan Taylor, but Pittman projects to remain the top dog in a receiving corps that also includes rookie second-round pick Adonai Mitchell, Josh Downs (ankle) and Alec Pierce. Pittman will begin the regular season Sunday, Sept. 8 against a Texans team that held him to two of his six lowest single-game yardage totals in 2023. ", " Kylen Granson ColtsTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:01 PM Granson caught two of three targets for 17 yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Granson was the intended receiver on Anthony Richardson's pick six on the second drive, which was the result of a miscommunication between the quarterback and tight end. Despite that miscue, it was encouraging that Granson got the lion's share of playing time in the five possessions that Richardson and the first-team offense played, finishing as one of three players to catch multiple passes from Richardson. After leading all Colts tight ends with 368 receiving yards in 2023, Granson appears positioned to earn his share of targets this coming season. ", " Alec Pierce ColtsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 7:59 PM Pierce caught both of his targets for 31 yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Pierce will be hoping that the opening drive was a preview of what we'll see in the regular season, as he caught two of Anthony Richardson's first three passes and accounted for 31 of Richardson's 65 passing yards on the possession. That drive was capped by a nine-yard touchdown catch from rookie first-round pick Adonai Mitchell, who is competing with Pierce for regular-season playing time. If Josh Downs (ankle) isn't ready to play in the Sept. 8 season opener against the Texans, both Pierce and Mitchell would be in line for significant roles alongside No. 1 receiver Michael Pittman. ", " Jonathan Taylor ColtsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 7:58 PM Taylor rushed four times for 15 yards and caught his only target for eight yards in Thursday's 27-14 preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Taylor started the game but exited a few drives earlier than most of the other starters, allowing Tyler Goodson and Evan Hull to get some first-team reps. None of the other running backs in the organization are likely to do much besides spell Taylor when he needs a breather as long as the workhorse remains healthy. Even with more than two weeks to recover before the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Texans, the Colts understandably limited Taylor's workload in the preseason finale, as he's expected to regularly see 20-plus touches after averaging 19.8 combined rushing attempts and receptions per game over his previous four NFL regular seasons. ", " Ben Skowronek TexansWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 7:14 PM Skowronek (leg) practiced Wednesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC2 Houston reports. Spin:Skowronek, who sat out last week's preseason contest, figures to see action in Saturday's finale against the Rams, his former team. Depth spots are up for grabs, and Skowronek will continue to battle with John Metchie, Xavier Hutchinson, Robert Woods and Steven Sims. ", " Davis Mills TexansQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 7:07 PM Mills (ribs) returned to practice Wednesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC2 Houston reports. Spin:Mills missed last Saturday's preseason game against the Giants with bruised ribs sustained during a preseason tilt the previous week against the Steelers. He looked sharp, per Wilson, delivering touchdown passes to John Metchie and Xavier Hutchinson. It's unclear if Mills will suit up for Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams. One thing that's certain is a healthy Mills will enter the regular season as the backup to C.J. Stroud. ", " Foster Moreau SaintsTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 5:43 PM Moreau is healthy in advance of the 2024 season, Ross Jackson of WWL Louisiana reports. Spin:After free agency opened in March 2023, Moreau underwent a physical with the Saints, which revealed a diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. He immediately began treatment, signed a contract with New Orleans in May and was deemed to be in remission in early July. He proceeded to play in 15 regular-season games en route to a 21-193-1 line on 25 targets, but he revealed that the ankle injury that forced DNPs in Weeks 3 and 4 impacted him the rest of the way and eventually resulted in surgery in early January. With a little more than two weeks remaining before the 2024 campaign, Moreau is positioned behind Juwan Johnson on the TE depth chart, likely leaving him with a similar role to last year. ", " Boston Scott RamsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 4:28 PM Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Thursday that Scott is dealing with a \"little bit of a leg contusion,\" Cameron DaSilva of USA Today reports. Spin:The injury doesn't appear to be serious, with McVay relaying that Scott is set to receive \"a big workload\" in Saturday's preseason finale against Houston. Scott signed a one-year contract with the Rams in April after spending the first six years of his NFL career with the Eagles. The 2018 sixth-round pick is currently pencilled in as the Rams' fourth running back on the depth chart behind Kyren Williams, rookie Blake Corum and Ronnie Rivers. ", " Emanuel Wilson PackersRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 4:28 PM Wilson is considered likely to make Green Bay's 53-man roster, Zach Kruse of USA Today reports. Spin:Rookie MarShawn Lloyd is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury, and AJ Dillon is dealing with a neck stinger, which could provide a path for Wilson to make the Packers' Week 1 roster. The 25-year-old rushed 14 times for 85 scoreless yards and caught four passes for 23 yards last season with Green Bay. There's an outside shot Wilson has a role in the season opener behind Josh Jacobs if both Lloyd and Dillon remain on the shelf. ", " Giovanni Ricci FATE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 4:22 PM The Browns released Ricci (knee) with an injury settlement Thursday. Spin:Ricci injured his knee in Cleveland's second preseason game against Minnesota on Saturday. He was competing for a depth tight end spot on the Browns' 53-man roster, but now that he's been let go, he'll look to catch on with a team once he's fully healthy. Ricci played in five regular-season games for the Panthers in 2023, finishing with one catch for two yards while playing 100 snaps (12 on offense, 88 on special teams). ", " Zack Moss BengalsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 4:11 PM Moss isn't slated to play in Thursday's preseason game versus the Colts, Kelsey Conway of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports. Spin:Moss and the rest of the Bengals' starters won't suit up in the team's exhibition finale. Beyond Moss, it's unclear if No. 2 RB Chase Brown will be included among the regulars who won't dress Thursday, but if he does, Cincinnati's backfield would be composed of Trayveon Williams, Noah Cain and Elijah Collins. Moss himself is in line to be the Bengals' lead runner this season after a 2023 campaign in which he posted 986 yards from scrimmage and seven TDs on 210 touches in 14 regular-season games with the Colts. ", " Tee Higgins BengalsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 4:04 PM Higgins isn't in line to play in Thursday's preseason game against the Colts, Kelsey Conway of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports. Spin:Higgins thus will make just one appearance during exhibition season, having hauled in two of three targets for 19 yards and a touchdown from QB Joe Burrow back in preseason Week 1 versus the Buccaneers. Fellow WR Ja'Marr Chase returned to the Bengals' facility Monday after he was away from the team for most of the previous week due to his ongoing contract dispute. It doesn't seem likely that the situation will linger into the regular season, but if it does, Higgins would be the clear-cut top pass catcher in Cincinnati's offense for as long as Chase doesn't suit up. ", " Sterling Shepard BuccaneersWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 3:53 PM Shepard (undisclosed) is not likely to suit up for the Buccaneers' preseason finale against the Dolphins on Friday, Greg Auman of Fox Sports reports. Spin:An unspecified injury has kept Shepard from playing in either of the Bucs' first two preseason games, and it appears he will also sit out for the preseason finale Friday. Despite missing an extended amount of time, the 2016 second-round pick is expected to make Tampa Bay's 53-man roster as a backup wide receiver behind Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan. Shepard signed a one-year deal with the Bucs in June after spending the first eight years of his NFL career with the Giants. ", " DeWayne McBride VikingsRB Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 3:44 PM McBride (knee) was limited to individual work on the sidelines during Thursday's practice session, Andrew Krammer of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Spin:McBride was seen with a wrap on his right knee Thursday, and he was held out of team drills. The 2023 seventh-round pick played 27 snaps (15 on offense, 12 on special teams) in the Vikings' second preseason game against the Browns, finishing the contest with 17 rushing yards on six carries. McBride is competing against Kene Nwangwu and Myles Gaskin for a depth running back role behind Aaron Jones and Ty Chandler. ", " Tyler Lockett SeahawksWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 3:18 PM Lockett (leg) didn't take part in Thursday's practice, Brady Henderson of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Lockett now has been sidelined for more than a week due to a leg injury that coach Mike Macdonald didn't consider to be serious last Wednesday, Aug. 14, per Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic. As a result, the Seahawks seem to be exercising caution with the nine-year pro to make sure he's healthy for a Week 1 matchup with the Broncos in Sunday, Sept. 8. ", " David Bell BrownsWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:56 PM Bell has not participated in practice since injuring his quadriceps in Cleveland's preseason opener against Green Bay, Kelsey Russo of the the Browns' official site reports. Spin:With Bell missing nearly two weeks of practice, it's unlikely that the 2022 third-round pick will suit up for the Browns' preseason finale against the Seahawks on Saturday. Bell has had a strong training camp, and despite missing multiple weeks due to injury, he is expected to make the 53-man roster as a depth wide receiver behind starters Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore. ", " Quintin Morris BillsTE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:51 PM Head coach Sean McDermott said Thursday that Morris (shoulder) is trending in the right direction with his injury recovery and could be available for the regular-season opener against the Cardinals on Sept. 8, Alec White of the Bills' official site reports. Spin:Morris sustained a shoulder injury in Saturday's preseason game against Pittsburgh. It appeared he was in jeopardy of missing multiple regular-season games, but the third-year tight end could be available for Week 1 if his recovery continues to progress well. Morris is currently slated as the third tight end on the Bills' depth chart behind Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox. ", " DJ Chark Jr. ChargersWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:50 PM Chark (undisclosed) remained sidelined at practice Thursday, Kris Rhim of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Chark was shook up during Monday's practice, with Daniel Popper of The Athletic suggesting afterward that the wideout may have sustained a hip issue. With another missed practice under his belt Thursday, Chark doesn't seem likely to play in Saturday's preseason finale against the Cowboys. ", " Mitchell Trubisky BillsQB Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:45 PM During Buffalo's press conference Thursday, head coach Sean McDermott did not rule out Trubisky (knee) for the Bills' regular-season opener against the Cardinals on Sept. 8, Alec White of the team's official site reports. Spin:Trubisky injured his knee in Saturday's preseason game against the Steelers. Initial reports indicated that the injury would sideline the 2017 first-round quarterback for multiple weeks, but McDermott seemed to indicate Thursday that Trubisky has a chance at suiting up for Week 1. If not, Ben DiNucci -- who Buffalo signed on Aug. 12 after Shane Buechele landed on IR with a neck injury -- would serve as the backup quarterback behind Josh Allen to start the season, while Anthony Brown would fill in as the emergency QB. ", " Isiah Pacheco ChiefsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:40 PM Pacheco is among the Chiefs' key skill players not likely to see action in Thursday's preseason finale against the Bears, Adam Teicher of ESPN.com reports. Spin:The same applies to QB Patrick Mahomes, fellow RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire, WRs Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Justin Watson and TEs Travis Kelce and Noah Gray. As Week 1 approaches, Pacheco is entrenched as Kansas City's lead back, so Thursday's contest should provide Deneric Prince, Carson Steele, Keaontay Ingram, Louis Rees-Zammit and Emani Bailey with opportunities to support their cases for depth slotting in the team's backfield. ", " Logan Thomas 49ersTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:26 PM The 49ers re-signed Thomas on Thursday. Spin:The 49ers cut Thomas earlier this month, but he's back with the team to provide depth behind top tight end George Kittle. In that context, Thomas' initial fantasy upside is limited, but the 33-year-old did catch 55 passes with the Commanders last season and could provide streaming value in the event that Kittle misses time. ", " Mohamed Ibrahim VikingsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:23 PM Ibrahim signed a contract with the Vikings on Thursday, Craig Peters of the team's official site reports. Spin:Ibrahim ended last season on the Lions' practice squad injured list after suffering a hip dislocation on a kickoff return in Week 7 against Baltimore. He received full medical clearance Aug. 13, and while he's unlikely to make Minnesota's 53-man roster, he can make a case for himself to stick around on the team's practice squad. ", " SaRodorick Thompson Jr. RamsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:17 PM The Rams signed Thompson to a contract Thursday. Spin:Thompson spent portions of the 2023 season on the Seahawks' practice squad. He was elevated for Week 7 against the Cardinals, when he took two snaps on offense without accruing a stat. It's unlikely that Thompson will crack the Rams' 53-man roster, but a good showing for the rest of training camp and in the preseason finale against the Texans on Saturday could help his chances of sticking around on the practice squad. ", " Noah Fant SeahawksTE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 2:03 PM Coach Mike Macdonald noted Thursday that the Seahawks are optimistic both Fant (foot) and Pharaoh Brown (foot) will be available for the team's regular-season opener, Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic reports. Spin:Macdonald's comments Thursday effectively confirm that Fant won't play in the team's preseason finale against the Browns on Saturday, but it looks like the Seahawks could have both of their top tight ends available for Week 1 action. Added context on that front will arrive no later than the first official practice/injury report the team releases in advance of a Sept. 8 matchup against the Broncos. ", " Geno Smith SeahawksQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 1:48 PM Coach Mike Macdonald relayed Thursday that most of Seattle's starters, including Smith, are in line to play in the team's preseason finale against the Browns on Saturday, Curtis Crabtree of Fox 13 Seattle and Gregg Bell of The Tacoma News Tribune report. Spin:Smith didn't see action in either of the Seahawks' first two exhibition contests, but he's slated to get some work in this weekend, along with the team's other healthy starters on offense. Once Smith gives way to his backups Saturday, his focus will turn to a Week 1 matchup against the Broncos. ", " Sam Darnold VikingsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 1:37 PM Coach Kevin O'Connell relayed Thursday that that Darnold's teammate Jaren Hall will start Saturday's preseason finale against the Eagles. Spin:O'Connell added that Matt Corral is likely to see snaps after Hall on Saturday, with Darnold's next start thus slated to occur Week 1 against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 8. The veteran QB is slated to open the regular season as Minnesota's top signal-caller, with first-round rookie J.J. McCarthy having landed on IR last week due to a knee injury. ", " Jaren Hall VikingsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 1:21 PM Coach Kevin O'Connell noted Thursday that Hall will start Saturday's preseason finale against the Eagles. Spin:Without naming specific players, O'Connell implied that a number of regulars are in line to be rested Saturday, while adding that Matt Corral is likely to see snaps after Hall. With that in mind, we wouldn't expect to see starter Sam Darnold face Philadelphia. ", " David Njoku BrownsTE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:41 AM Njoku (undisclosed) didn't practice Wednesday, Kelsey Russo of the Browns' official site reports. Spin:Given that Njoku hasn't practiced since Aug. 15, it seems unlikely that he'll see action in the Browns' preseason finale against the Seahawks on Saturday. If that's the case, the focus of the team's top TE will then pivot to preparing for a Week 1 matchup against the Cowboys on Sunday, Sept. 8. ", " Amari Cooper BrownsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:37 AM Cooper (undisclosed) fully participated in Wednesday's practice, Kelsey Russo of the Browns' official site reports. Spin:Cooper went through the walkthrough portion of Tuesday's session but didn't participate in practice. After working fully Wednesday, however, the Browns' top wideout is a candidate to see action in the team's preseason finale Saturday against the Seahawks, with coach Kevin Stefanski having said earlier in the week that Cleveland's starters should expect to play in the contest. ", " Marquez Valdes-Scantling BillsWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:29 AM When asked Thursday about the chances of Valdes-Scantling (neck) and Curtis Samuel (turf toe) playing Week 1, coach Sean McDermott expressed a degree of optimism, Alec White of the Bills' official site reports. Spin:\"I feel like those two, from what I've heard so far, have a real good chance of being back, just not committing to it yet,\" McDermott noted of Valdes-Scantling and Samuel. Once available, Valdes-Scantling will look to solidify his standing in a Buffalo WR corps that also includes Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman, Samuel, Mack Hollins and KJ Hamler. ", " Curtis Samuel BillsWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:24 AM When asked about the chances of Samuel (turf toe) and fellow WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling (neck) playing Week 1, coach Sean McDermott expressed some optimism, Alec White of the Bills' official site reports. Spin:\"I feel like those two, from what I've heard so far, have a real good chance of being back, just not committing to it yet,\" McDermott said of the injured pass-catching duo. Added context regarding Samuel's status for the Bills' Sept. 8 contest against the Cardinals will arrive no later than the posting of the team's initial practice/injury report ahead of Week 1, but once the 28-year-old is healthy he'll have a chance to claim a key role in Buffalo's retooled wide receiver corps. ", " Treylon Burks TitansWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 10:08 AM Burks participated in practice Thursday, Jim Wyatt of the Titans' official site reports. Spin:Per Wyatt, Burks, who left Wednesday's practice with a trainer after landing hard on the field, appeared unhindered Thursday, which sets the stage for the wideout to be available for Sunday's preseason finale against the Saints. The Titans remain hopeful that DeAndre Hopkins (knee) will be ready for Week 1 action, but in the meantime, Burks is in a position to see added WR reps alongside Calvin Ridley and Tyler Boyd. ", " Clayton Tune CardinalsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 9:24 AM Tune is slated to start Sunday's preseason finale against the Broncos, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports. Spin:With Kyler Murray not in line to see any exhibition action, Tune will get the starting nod Sunday and will be followed by Desmond Ridder. Tune and Ridder remain in contention to work as Murray's top backup, though Rapoport suggests that the Cardinals could elect to keep all three QB's on their initial 53-man roster. ", " Brandon Aiyuk 49ersWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:23 AM 49ers GM John Lynch said Thursday that he has no update on Aiyuk but remains in contact with the wide receiver, Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Spin:It's the offseason drama with no end, although at some point it might become slightly less complicated due to other teams losing interest in a trade (or at least giving San Francisco a deadline). The Steelers were thought to be the last man standing in that regard a week ago, with Cleveland and New England having failed to convince Aiyuk to sign a long-term deal post-trade. The 49ers still hope to sign him -- or at least get him back on the field under the fifth-year option he's currently under contract for -- and it would seem a trade becomes less and less likely with each passing day. ", " Jakobi Meyers RaidersWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 8:10 AM Meyers and other starters aren't scheduled to play in Friday's preseason game against the 49ers, Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com reports. Spin:It sounds like the Raiders may also hold out some of their better backups, as QB Aidan O'Connell isn't expected to play Friday night. Come Week 1, the team will have a strong group of pass catchers competing for targets from Gardner Minshew in a road game against the Chargers. It'll be tricky for Meyers to match his 2023 numbers for volume (106 targets in 16 games) or touchdowns (eight rushing, two receiving), but there's no question he'll be on the field for a lot of snaps as either the second or third option in the Raiders' passing game (depending on rookie TE Brock Bowers' usage/progress). ", " Aaron Rodgers JetsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 7:59 AM Rodgers and other starters aren't in line to play in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants, Rich Cimini of ESPN.com reports. Spin:As expected, given previous reports that Rodgers wouldn't play this preseason. His first game appearance since suffering an Achilles' tear will come Week 1 at San Francisco on Monday Night Football, against a defense led by DE Nick Bosa, LB Fred Warner and CB Charvarius Ward. The Niners may start off without two of their better defensive players from last year, as LB Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) and S Talanoa Hufanga (ACL) are still on the PUP list heading into the final week of August. ", " Aidan O'Connell RaidersQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 6:57 AM Coach Antonio Pierce said Wednesday that O'Connell won't play in Friday's preseason game against the 49ers, Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Neither will Gardner Minshew, who was named the Week 1 starter Sunday. O'Connell will enter the regular season as the Raiders' No. 2 quarterback, after completing 21 of 29 passes for 176 yards, one TD and one INT in two preseason appearances. ", " Gardner Minshew RaidersQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 6:56 AM Minshew and other starters won't play in Friday's preseason finale against the 49ers, Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Minshew was competent but unspectacular this preseason, completing 16 of 33 passes for 212 yards in two games, without any touchdowns or turnovers. Raiders coach Antonio Pierce named the 28-year-old as his Week 1 starter Sunday, leaving Aidan O'Connell as the backup QB heading into a season opener on the road against the Chargers (Sept. 8). In the meantime, Minshew and O'Connell both will sit out the final preseason game, leaving Carter Bradley and Nathan Peterman to handle QB snaps. ", " Riley Patterson FAK News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 6:37 AM The Commanders waived Patterson on Thursday. Spin:Washington traded for Cade York, who now replaces Patterson as the only kicker on the roster. It's possible Patterson gets a look from another team with a shaky placekicking situation, but he may have to settle for a spot on a practice squad or waiting for a call in-season. ", " Cade York CommandersK News Archive \t THU, AUG 22, 6:33 AM The Browns traded York to the Commanders on Thursday for a conditional seventh-round pick, ESPN's John Keim reports. Spin:The Commanders then cut Riley Patterson, leaving York as the only kicker on their roster. Meanwhile, Dustin Hopkins (undisclosed) is left as the lone kicker for Cleveland, suggesting the team isn't worried that his recent, minor injury will impact his Week 1 availability. The Browns took York in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft, but he was waived the following preseason after missing eight field-goal attempts his rookie year. He then spent time with the Giants and Titans before landing back in Cleveland this spring. August 21 Devin Asiasi FATE News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 5:16 PM The Browns hosted Asisasi for a tryout Wednesday, Ben Volin of The Boston Globe reports. Spin:Asiasi spent training camp with the Bengals in 2023 before being let go, ultimately having stints on the practice squad with the Browns and Titans. He's now getting another look with Cleveland. If signed, the 27-year-old would operate as another depth option behind David Njoku at tight end. ", " Tyree Jackson FATE Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 2:36 PM Jackson (undisclosed) was waived from IR with an injury settlement, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Jackson reverted to IR on Saturday after he was waived with an injury designation Friday. He'll now have a chance to avoid missing the 2024 season and can sign with any team once he proves himself healthy. ", " Freddie Swain BearsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 11:31 AM Swain (undisclosed) was let go from injured reserve with an injury settlement Saturday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The wide receiver now has a chance to play in 2024 if he can catch on with another team. Swain spent the majority of the 2023 season on the Dolphins' practice squad. The 26-year-old caught 42 passes for 576 yards and six touchdowns with Seattle and Denver between 2020 and 2022. ", " Pierre Strong Jr. BrownsRB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 2:30 PM Strong was released from the hospital Wednesday after being diagnosed with a rib contusion, Daniel Oyefusi of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Strong left Wednesday's practice in an ambulance as a precaution after experiencing shortness of breath as a result of the injury, according to a statement provided by the Browns. Strong, who could open the season as the No. 2 running back behind Jerome ford, looks to have avoided a serious injury, but he could still be held out of Saturday's preseason finale against the Seahawks. ", " Trent Taylor 49ersWR Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 1:57 PM Taylor (undisclosed) worked off on the sideline during Wednesday's practice, Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com reports. Spin:It seems that Taylor sustained an injury in recent days, as he didn't participate in team drills Wednesday. The Lousianna Tech product is battling for the team's top kick and punt returner spot, so missing time could hurt his chances of winning those jobs. Expect Ronnie Bell to assume all the first-team punt and kick return duties while Taylor nurses his injury. ", " Danny Gray 49ersWR Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 1:51 PM Gray was held out of Wednesday's practice due to an undisclosed injury, Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com reports. Spin:The SMU product is likely fighting for a depth role in San Francisco's wide receiver room, so missing time likely hurts his chances of making the team's 53-man roster. With Gray sidelined again, expect Tay Martin and Robbie Chosen to see more reps in the preseason. ", " Clyde Edwards-Helaire ChiefsRB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 1:32 PM Edwards-Helaire (illness) remains in line to fill a depth role out of the backfield behind Isiah Pacheco to begin the regular season, Jesse Newell of the Kansas City Star reports. Spin:Edwards-Helaire, who revealed last month that he deals with post-traumatic stress disorder, has missed a number of practices in training camp. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said Tuesday that despite the missed time, the Chiefs \"know who Clyde is and what he's done\" and \"know now what his strengths are\" and \"how to use him.\" Along with Edwards-Helaire, Deneric Prince and Carson Steele are also in the team's running back mix behind Pacheco. ", " Jarrett Stidham BroncosQB News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 1:09 PM Stidham is primed to open the regular season as the top backup to Bo Nix, whom coach Sean Payton named the Broncos' starting quarterback Wednesday. Spin:Stidham has been outplayed by Nix, the No. 12 overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft, across two preseason games, so Payton's decision doesn't come as much of a surprise. Nix also boasts ample experience as a collegiate starter, while Stidham's modest arm strength and lack of scrambling potential leave him more comfortable in a reserve role. Barring an injury to Nix, Stidham is unlikely to see extended action for Denver this season, though he does seem comfortably ahead of No. 3 quarterback Zach Wilson on the depth chart. ", " Devaughn Vele BroncosWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 12:31 PM Vele (undisclosed) returned to practice Wednesday, Ryan McFadden of The Denver Post reports. Spin:Vele was held out of Sunday's preseason game against the Packers with an undisclosed injury, but it now appears he's moved past the issue. Now that the rookie out of Utah is back to full health, he's expected to compete for a depth role in the Denver's WR room as the preseason progresses. ", " Sage Surratt CardinalsTE News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 12:24 PM The Cardinals signed Surratt on Wednesday, Josh Weinfuss of ESPN.com reports. Spin:After a stint with the New Orleans Breakers of the USFL in 2023, Surratt has found a new home in Arizona. The former wide receiver turned tight end has yet to appear in an NFL game and will likely battle for a depth role on the Cardinals 53-man roster or practice squad as the preseason continues. ", " Drew Lock GiantsQB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 12:13 PM Lock (hip) didn't participate in team drills Wednesday, Patricia Traina of SI.com reports. Spin:The Giants' No. 2 quarterback injured his hip during the team's first preseason game against the Lions, and he's yet to return to the field. While Lock remains sidelined, expect Tommy DeVito to take snaps as New York's second-string quarterback. ", " C.J. Uzomah FATE News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 11:29 AM Uzomah was released by the Eagles on Wednesday, EJ Smith of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Spin:Uzomah's exit comes as a bit of a surprise after signing a one-year contract with the team in April. His departure will leave Albert Okwuegbunam, E.J. Jenkins, Kevin Foelsch and Armani Rogers battling for what will likely be one or two spots on the Eagles' final 53-man roster at tight end. ", " Dalton Keene TexansTE Injured Reserve News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 11:12 AM Keene (knee) was placed on injured reserve Wednesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Keene tore his ACL in Saturday's exhibition win over the Giants and will now miss the entirety of the 2024 campaign. It's another tough break for the Virginia Tech product who has struggled to get his career on track since missing the 2021 campaign due to meniscus damage. ", " Roman Wilson SteelersWR Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 10:01 AM Wilson (ankle) said Wednesday that he won't be available for Saturday's preseason finale against the Lions, Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Spin:That said, Wilson indicated that he hopes to be back in action soon. The rookie third-round pick suffered a left ankle sprain at the end of July, and at that time, he was viewed as week-to-week. Given that he's still sidelined, the rookie's status for the Sept. 8 regular-season opener in Atlanta is unclear. Once he's healthy, Wilson will look to secure a steady role in a Pittsburgh wideout corps headlined by George Pickens. ", " AJ Dillon PackersRB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 8:16 AM Head coach Matt LaFleur said Wednesday that the Packers will be cautious with Dillon (neck) because \"anytime you have a repeated injury there's concern,\" Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Dillon missed Week 18 and two playoff games last season with a neck stinger, and he's now dealing with the same injury less than three weeks before Green Bay's Week 1 contest Sept. 6 against the Eagles in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Meanwhile, rookie running back MarShawn Lloyd is still recovering from a hamstring strain, leaving Emanuel Wilson, Ellis Merriweather and Nate McCrary as the depth backs behind Josh Jacobs. Wilson appears in good shape to clinch a spot on the Week 1 roster, and he might even get some carries if Dillon and Lloyd aren't available. ", " Parris Campbell EaglesWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 7:52 AM Campbell (groin) appears to be a full practice participant Wednesday, EJ Smith of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Spin:Campbell returned to limited participation last week and is now practicing without any restrictions. He's competing for the No. 3 receiver job, with challengers Johnny Wilson and John Ross both in concussion protocol at the moment. ", " Kendre Miller SaintsRB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 7:35 AM Miller (hamstring) may be placed on injured reserve to start the season, which would rule him out for the first four games, Jeff Nowak of The Big 870 New Orleans reports. Spin:Placing Miller on IR would allow the Saints to keep him around without dedicating a 53-man roster spot on a young player that hasn't practiced at all this summer. The 2023 third-round pick had issues with his knee, hamstring and ankle as a rookie, and he's now been sidelined by another hamstring injury since making an early exit from the first practice of training camp. Alvin Kamara and Jamaal Williams are likely to open the season atop the depth chart at running back, with the No. 3 role likely going to either Jordan Mims, James Robinson or a post-cutdown addition. Saints head coach Dennis Allen has been critical of Miller's struggles to stay healthy this summer, removing much of the luster from a young back that was a popular sleeper pick for fantasy not long ago. ", " Dallas Goedert EaglesTE Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 7:28 AM Goedert missed Wednesday's practice with an oblique injury, Bob Brookover of The Newark Star-Ledger reports. Spin:Goedert missed three games in November and December of last season due to a forearm fracture, but the oblique injury is the first known health concern that the tight end has tended to ever since. He's missed multiple games four seasons in a row, but never more than five in any one season. Goedert will have 16 days to recover from the oblique injury before the Eagles open their season with a matchup with the Packers in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Sept. 6. ", " Jerry Jeudy BrownsWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 7:04 AM Jeudy participated in joint practices with the Vikings last week and may play in Saturday's preseason game versus the Seahawks, Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Spin:Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski suggested that quarterback Deshaun Watson and other starters are scheduled to play in Saturday's preseason finale, after most of the team's key players were held out for the first two exhibitions. That includes Jeudy, who dealt with a knee injury earlier in training camp but has now been a full practice participant for about a week. The 25-year-old will be Cleveland's No. 2 wideout, slotting in between top option Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore on the depth chart. August 20 Jordan Addison VikingsWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:19 PM Addison (ankle) did not practice Tuesday, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Spin:Addison was carted off the field during an Aug. 14 practice with an ankle injury. Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said the next day that Addison did not suffer a major injury and isn't expected to miss extended time. However, there's no clear timetable for his return. It seems unlikely he'll play in any more preseason games. ", " Alvin Kamara SaintsRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 5:40 PM Kamara (back) returned to practice Tuesday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Spin:While it was a lighter practice, according to Matthew Paras of NOLA.com, Kamara's return is certainly a positive sign. Kamara had been sidelined since Aug. 13 with back tightness. Given the veteran's status as the team's No. 1 option in the backfield, it would not be surprising to see head coach Dennis Allen continue to exercise caution with his availability going forward in preseason competition. ", " Ty Johnson BillsRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 5:31 PM Johnson carried the ball once for six yards in Saturday's preseason win over the Steelers. He was not targeted in the passing game. Spin:Johnson was and perhaps still is in the running to be James Cook's primary backup, but he hurt his hamstring in late July and missed the first preseason game, then finally returned to practice last week and played just seven snaps Saturday. Rookie Ray Davis looks like the favorite for the job now, though the Bills could mix and match when Cook needs a breather due to the differing skill sets of Johnson and Davis. It's worth noting that undrafted rookie Frank Gore ran well Saturday, logging eight carries for 41 yards, while veteran Darrynton Evans ran seven times for 37 yards. ", " Nick Bawden TexansRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 5:06 PM The Texans signed Bawden to a contract Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Bawden was let go by the Jets on July 30, one day after being reinstated from the active/PUP list due to an undisclosed injury. He appeared in 16 regular-season games for the Jets last year, finishing with two carries for four yards and one touchdown while catching three passes for 21 yards. Bawden will provide Houston depth at fullback with Andrew Beck sidelined with a calf injury. ", " Nyheim Hines BrownsRB Out News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 5:04 PM Hines is making progress in recovering from the ACL injury that kept him out for the entire 2023 season, Kelsey Russo of the Browns' official site reports. Spin:Hines hasn't suited up for game action since the 2022 season, and there's still no concrete timetable for his return. But Coach Kevin Stefanski struck an optimistic tone Tuesday, saying, \"He's doing well and progressing well.\" Even when he's at 100 percent though, he'll have to fight to earn a spot on Cleveland's running back depth chart. ", " Ethan Fernea FAWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 5:02 PM Indianapolis waived Fernea (undisclosed) from its injured reserve with an injury settlement Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Fernea appeared in the Colts' preseason opener against the Broncos, catching his lone target for 18 yards while playing 19 snaps (16 on offense, three on special teams). He was waived by Indianapolis on Wednesday and reverted to the Colts' IR after going unclaimed off waivers. Fernea was set to miss the entire 2024 season, but with the injury settlement, he will be able to sign with another team once he's fully healthy. ", " Frank Darby FAWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:49 PM San Francisco waived Darby (undisclosed) from its injured reserve list with an injury settlement Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The injury settlement means he won't be forced to sit out of the entire 2024 season by rule. If he were to come back during the current campaign though, it might have to be with a different team. ", " Scotty Washington FATE Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:44 PM Baltimore waived Washington (hand) with an injury settlement Tuesday, Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic reports. Spin:Washington sustained a fracture in his hand during the preseason, and the Ravens have now decided to part ways with him. His injury settlement means he would technically be allowed to play at some point during the 2024 season after he recovers from his hand issue. ", " Henry Pearson PackersTE News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:19 PM The Packers signed Pearson to a contract Tuesday, Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Pearson was waived by the Packers in late July, but he is back with the team after Jarveon Howard was waived with an undisclosed injury designation Tuesday. Pearson spent most of 2023 on Green Bay's practice squad after failing to make the 53-man roster at the end of training camp. He appeared in two regular-season games last year, accumulating 34 snaps (11 on offense, 23 on special teams) while not recording a tackle. ", " Tyler Davis PackersTE Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:14 PM Davis is being limited by a shoulder injury Tuesday, Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports. Spin:It's not clear at this point when Davis sustained the injury or how serious it might be. If it causes him to miss time, it's possible that Joel Wilson could see more opportunities during practice. ", " Zach Charbonnet SeahawksRB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:08 PM Charbonnet (undisclosed) practiced Tuesday but was held out from team drills, Bob Condotta of The Seattle Times reports. Spin:Charbonnet has been sidelined due to an undisclosed injury described by the team only as \"tightness\" since last Wednesday, so it's encouraging to see him get some on-field work in while wearing full pads. The second-year running back is expected to sit out Saturday's preseason finale against the Browns, but he shouldn't have any issue getting back to 100 percent health in time for Seattle's regular-season opener against the Broncos on Sept. 8. ", " Dennis Houston FAWR Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 21, 2:25 PM Houston (undisclosed) reverted to injured reserve Wednesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Houston was waived with an injury designation Monday, seemingly after suffering an undisclosed injury in Saturday's preseason game against the Texans. The Western Illinois product will now miss the 2024 campaign unless he reaches an injury settlement with the team. ", " Dante Miller GiantsRB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 3:11 PM Miller (hamstring) was a limited participant at practice Tuesday, Dan Duggan of The Athletic reports. Spin:Miller rushed for 63 yards on 12 carries in the Giants' preseason opener against the Lions, but he was unable to suit up for Saturday's contest against the Texans due to a hamstring injury. He'll be slowly worked back into practice in the hopes he can suit up for Saturday's preseason finale against the Jets. Miller is competing for a depth spot at running back behind starter Devin Singletary. ", " Robert Tonyan VikingsTE Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 3:10 PM Tonyan (back) participated in positional drills during Tuesday's practice, Ben Goessling of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Spin:Tonyan hadn't practiced fully since July 31 due to back spasms, so it's encouraging to see him back on the field in some capacity. With T.J. Hockenson (knee) expected to miss time early in the regular season while working his way back from an ACL tear, Tonyan could offer some fantasy value in deeper formats if he's able to get healthy and suit up against the Giants in Week 1. ", " Hendon Hooker LionsQB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 2:43 PM Head coach Dan Campbell stated Tuesday that he'd like Hooker to start Saturday against the Steelers, Eric Woodyard of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Hooker is currently in a battle with Nate Sufeld for the backup quarterback job behind Jared Goff. The second-year pro was arguably the better performer in the Lions' win over the Chiefs last Saturday, completing 12 of 15 passes for 150 yards while he also rushed for a touchdown. ", " Jaylen Warren SteelersRB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 1:32 PM Coach Mike Tomlin noted Tuesday that Warren \"is out, probably out for this week,\" but added that the running back's hamstring issue is \"not anything that's a long-term concern,\" Brooke Pryor of ESPN.com reports. Spin:While it's probably safe to assume that Warren won't play in Saturday's preseason finale against the Lions, Tomlin's words Tuesday would appear to bode well with regard to the running back's chances of being available for Week 1 action. Once he's back on the field, Warren will resume working in Pittsburgh's backfield in tandem with Najee Harris, a looming timeshare that should result in both players remaining on the fantasy radar this season. ", " Payne Durham BuccaneersTE News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 11:58 AM Durham (knee) is practicing Tuesday, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. Spin:Durham had been sidelined since suffering the injury last Wednesday during a joint practice with the Jaguars. His quick recovery should allow him to keep a firm grip on the team's No. 2 tight-end spot behind expected starter Cade Otton. ", " Joseph Ngata EaglesWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 11:20 AM Ngata (ankle) is practicing Tuesday, Dave Zangaro of NBC Sports Philadelphia reports. Spin:Ngata first missed practice Saturday and has been sidelined since. The Clemson product's quick return to practice should help him stay in contention for a spot on the Eagles' final 53-man roster. ", " DJ Moore BearsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:55 AM Coach Matt Eberflus said Tuesday that the majority of Chicago's starters, likely including Moore, will sit for Thursday's preseason finale against Kansas City, Kevin Fishbain of The Athletic reports. Spin:Eberflus specified that quarterback Caleb Williams won't play Thursday, and it seems all but assured that Moore will be included in the group of players held out until the regular-season opener against Tennessee. The wideout has spent the offseason developing chemistry with 2024 first overall pick Williams, whose presence under center promises to notably upgrade Chicago's passing game. Even if the additions of Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze threaten Moore's ability to replicate his 28.8 percent target share from last season, an improved offense as a whole should represent a net positive for Moore's fantasy prospects in terms of consistency. ", " Rasheen Ali RavensRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:55 AM Ali (neck) returned to practice Tuesday, Jonas Shaffer of TheBaltimoreBanner.comreports. Spin:A stinger had prevented Ali from participating in practice since the Ravens' preseason opener, but the 2024 fifth-rounder's return to the field Tuesday should allow him to resume competing for a depth role in Baltimore's backfield behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill. With Keaton Mitchell (knee) still on the PUP list, Ali's primary competition on that front is Owen Wright, who originally joined the team as an undrafted free agent last May. ", " Devontez Walker RavensWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:45 AM Walker (ribs) participated in practice Tuesday, Jonas Shaffer of TheBaltimoreBanner.com reports. Spin:Walker, who has been managing a rib issue, didn't practice Monday, but the 2024 fourth-rounder's return to the field a day later bodes well for his chances of seeing action in Saturday's preseason finale against the Packers. As the regular season approaches, Walker is looking to carve out a steady role as a rookie in a WR corps that also includes veterans Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and Nelson Agholor. ", " Brandin Cooks CowboysWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:34 AM Coach Mike McCarthy said Tuesday that Cooks (knee) will miss the Cowboys' next two practices for personal reasons, Calvin Watkins of The Dallas Morning News reports. Spin:Cooks, who worked with the rehab group Monday due to lingering knee soreness, will miss sessions Tuesday and Wednesday to fly back to Dallas, per Jon Machota of The Athletic. With CeeDee Lamb (holdout) still away from the team, Cooks' brief absence will provide Jalen Tolbert with another chance to lead the team's wide receiver group during practice. ", " Tyquan Thornton PatriotsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:25 AM Thornton, who Evan Lazar of the Patriots' official site projects to make the team's 53-man roster, has been running with New England's top offense this summer. Spin:Per Lazar, the 2022 second-rounder, who is playing at 192 pounds these days, looks more sturdy on the field with the added weight. Thornton struggled to stay healthy over his first two years as a pro, but he now has a chance to emerge as a field-stretcher in the Patriots offense. Whether such a role yields enough volume for him to make a fantasy impact remains to be seen, with DeMario Douglas, Ja'Lynn Polk, K.J. Osborn and Javon Baker also in the mix for targets in New England's re-tooled WR corps. ", " Matthew Stafford RamsQB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 10:25 AM Stafford (hamstring) is participating in team drills at the start of Tuesday's practice, Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic reports. Spin:Stafford was limited to individual work in his return to practice Monday, but he's now resumed handling normal reps. That's enough to alleviate any concerns about the 36-year-old signal-caller's health, though the plan for Los Angeles all along has been for Stetson Bennett to start Saturday's preseason finale against the Texans. The Rams also expect second-year wideout Puka Nacua (hamstring) to be available Week 1 versus the Lions, so with Cooper Kupp also entering the 2024 season healthy, Stafford will have both his top wideouts available to kick off the season. ", " Tyrone Tracy Jr. GiantsRB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 9:35 AM Tracy (ankle) will practice Tuesday, Dan Duggan of The Athletic reports. Spin:Even if he's a limited participant, the quick return to practice exactly a week after suffering an ankle sprain suggests Tracy is on track to play Week 1 against Minnesota. He dominated snaps in the early portion of New York's preseason opener with Devin Singletary resting, taking five carries for 26 yards in a 14-3 win over the Lions. Eric Gray was next through the rotation and had 98 yards from scrimmage and a pair of TDs, later adding three carries for 18 yards and five catches for 22 yards in the second preseason game (a loss to Houston). It's possible the third and final exhibition -- this Saturday against the Jets -- provides a hint as to whether Tracy or Gray will enter the regular season as the No. 2 RB behind Singletary. ", " Ja'Lynn Polk PatriotsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 7:18 AM Polk has been a regular presence on the first-team offense at practice this week, according to Doug Kyed of The Boston Herald. Spin:Polk saw almost all of his playing time with the second-string offense in New England's first two preseason games, but that's not necessarily a bad thing given that it allowed him to work with QB Drake Maye rather than Jacoby Brissett. It's possible both Maye and Polk end up starting Week 1 against the Bengals, and there's not much question they'll end up working together at some point this season even if it doesn't materialize for the opener. The Patriots took Maye with the third overall pick in April and then got Polk at No. 37. Polk caught five of six targets in the first two preseason games, but for only 20 yards. ", " Blake Grupe SaintsK News Archive \t TUE, AUG 20, 4:15 AM Grupe went 1-for-1 on field-goal attempts and converted his lone PAT in Sunday's 16-10 preseason loss to the 49ers. Spin:Grupe hit a 52-yarder early in the third quarter, and he now gone 3-for-3 on field-goal attempts and 2-for-2 on point-after tries this preseason. The second-year kicker also went back to handling almost the entirety of the Saints' kicking duties after first-year player Charlie Smyth hit the game-winning field-goal attempt in the team's preseason opener. While the latter kicker handled New Orleans' first kickoff of the second quarter, his scant usage seems to indicate that there isn't a legitimate kicking competition going on here this preseason. The Saints will wrap up their preseason schedule this coming Sunday with a final exhibition against the Titans. August 19 Samaje Perine BroncosRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:04 PM Perine rushed five times for 16 yards and caught one of his two targets for five yards in Sunday's 27-2 preseason win over the Packers. Spin:After failing to record a single rush or reception in the Broncos' first preseason game, Perine touched the ball on six of his 11 offensive snaps in the contest. The veteran running back remains in a crowded running back room, competing with presumed starter Javonte Williams, Jaleel McLaughlin and Audric Estime for playing time in the 2024 campaign. As the preseason nears its end, Perine will look to hold on to his roster spot in Denver. If he does, the 28-year-old would likely be the favorite to handle passing-down work. ", " Jake Haener SaintsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:29 PM Haener completed seven of 13 passes for 76 yards during Sunday's 16-10 preseason loss to the 49ers. He also logged one rush for two yards. Spin:Haener was the first Saints' quarterback to follow starter Derek Carr during the team's preseason opener, but he flipped spots with rookie Spencer Rattler on Sunday. However, neither quarterback performed particularly well, as both failed to lead a touchdown drive against the 49ers. They also both played exactly 24 offensive snaps. With the competition for the No. 2 quarterback spot apparently at a dead heat, it's likely that New Orleans' final decision on this job could come down to the coming week's practices followed by the preseason finale against Tennessee on Sunday, Aug. 25. ", " Spencer Rattler SaintsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:16 PM Rattler completed four of eight passes for 27 yards and logged three rushes for five yards during Sunday's 16-10 preseason defeat versus the 49ers. He also lost one fumble and was sacked twice. Spin:e Rattler seemingly took a step back after his strong preseason debut. The fifth-round rookie took over from starter Derek Carr midway through the second quarter, marking a change from the presason opener when second-year quarterback Jake Haener first followed Carr. However, Rattler got off to a rough start right away when he was strip-sacked on his fourth snap of the game Sunday, and the Saints finished with three points across Rattler's four offensive series. Haener and Rattler wound up playing exactly 24 offensive snaps against San Francisco, though neither seemed to separate themselves with their performances. Therefore, the competition for the team's No. 2 quarterback spot could come down to the preseason finale versus Tennessee on Sunday, Aug. 25. ", " Jordan Mims SaintsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:38 PM Mims logged 10 carries for 37 yards during Sunday's 16-10 preseason loss to the 49ers. He also returned two kickoffs for 44 net yards. Spin:Mims logged his first carry when the team's starting offense was still in the game early in the second quarter. The 25-year-old also logged more touches and offensive snaps (21) than fellow reserve running back James Robinson, who totaled seven touches on 18 offensive snaps. Meanwhile, 2023 third-round pick Kendre Miller continued to sit out after suffering a hamstring injury early in training camp. As long as Miller's absence continues, Mims and Robinson should be in primary contention for New Orleans' No. 3 running back spot behind Alvin Kamara and Jamaal Williams heading into the regular season. ", " Eno Benjamin FARB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 5:17 PM Benjamin (Achilles) tried out with Cleveland on Monday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Benjamin has seemingly recovered from a torn Achilles he suffered during practice with the Saints last summer. The 2020 seventh-round pick will now look to catch on with Cleveland or find a new opportunity elsewhere. ", " Tarik Black FAWR Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 4:56 PM The Steelers have reached an injury settlement with Black (undisclosed) , who had been on injured reserve. Spin:Black had just reverted to injured reserve last week but will now return become a free agent following the settlement. He will now look to get healthy and catch on with another team. ", " Salvon Ahmed FARB Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 4:51 PM Miami released Ahmed (undisclosed) with an injury waiver Monday, per the NFL's transaction log. Spin:The detail of the injury waiver is significant, as it means Ahmed is technically eligible to return at some point during the 2024 season if he can work through his health issues. For now, his departure could open up practice reps for the just-signed Anthony McFarland. ", " Anthony Brown Jr. FAQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 4:41 PM The Bills signed Brown on Monday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Spin:Brown was waived by the Raiders last week but will sign with Buffalo after going unclaimed. The 26-year-old will now have the opportunity to compete with Ben DiNucci to be Josh Allen's backup, as Mitch Trubisky is sidelined with a knee injury. ", " Dee Eskridge SeahawksWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 4:25 PM Eskridge (undisclosed) returned to practice Monday, Bob Condotta of The Seattle Times reports. Spin:Eskridge missed the Seahawks' preseason game versus the Titans on Saturday due to an undisclosed injury but is now healthy again. The 2021 second-round pick will now spend the next several weeks competing for a spot on the final roster, where he can add value both as a returner and as a depth receiver. ", " Pharaoh Brown SeahawksTE Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 4:14 PM Brown (foot) is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season, Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic reports. Spin:Brown received a second opinion on the foot injury he suffered last week and is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. If the 30-year-old however ends up taking more time to recover, Tyler Mabry and Brady Russell could be in line for expanded roles. ", " Willie Snead IV DolphinsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 2:54 PM The Dolphins released Snead (undisclosed) from the reserve/injured list Saturday with an injury settlement, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Snead caught on with Miami in late July after appearing in four regular-season games for the 49ers in 2023. He caught one pass for 13 yards across his two preseason outings with the Dolphins, but he was set to miss the entire 2024 season after being placed on injured reserve Monday. Now that he's been let go with an injury settlement, Snead will be able to sign with another team once he is fully healthy. ", " Eric Saubert 49ersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 2:47 PM Saubert has two receptions (three targets) for 11 yards through two preseason games with San Francisco. Spin:The veteran addition at tight end started both exhibition games while George Kittle sat out with most of the starters on offense. Saubert is known for his blocking skills as opposed to being a vertical threat, so his preseason game log might be a good representation of the kind of fantasy numbers we will see from the 30-year-old in 2024. ", " River Cracraft DolphinsWR Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 2:30 PM Coach Mike McDaniel said Monday that Cracraft (upper body) will be out for \"sometime for sure\" but added that his injury \"doesn't appear to be season-ending,\" Tom D'Angelo of the Palm Beach Post reports. Spin:Cracraft has spent training camp making a case for himself as the No. 3 wide receiver behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle (undisclosed), especially with Odell Beckham (undisclosed) still not practicing, but his status for Week 1 now looks up in the air. Cracraft was injured during Saturday's preseason game against Washington, while catching a 13-yard touchdown pass thrown by Tua Tagovailoa. As long as Cracraft is sidelined, depth players like rookie Malik Washington and Erik Ezukanma should benefit from additional opportunities. ", " Zander Horvath DolphinsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 2:14 PM The Dolphins signed Horvath to a contract Monday. Spin:Horvath, who was waived by the Saints last week, joins Miami's backfield along with Anthony McFarland on the same day the team released Salvon Ahmed. The Dolphins' initial transaction report lists Horvath as a running back rather than specifically as a fullback, which could be an indication that he'll have a chance to compete for depth backfield reps with his new team. ", " Max Duggan FAQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 1:31 PM Duggan was waived by the Chargers on Monday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Spin:Duggan was selected in the seventh round by Los Angeles in the 2023 NFL Draft. After not making the team's initial 53-man roster, the TCU product spent the 2023 campaign on the team's practice squad. Duggan's departure leaves Easton Stick and Luis Perez behind starter Justin Herbert on the team's quarterback depth chart. ", " Anthony McFarland Jr. DolphinsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 1:27 PM McFarland signed a contract with the Dolphins on Monday, Marcel Louis-Jacques of ESPN.com reports. Spin:McFarland was most recently with the San Antonio Brahmas of the UFL this spring after his contract with the Steelers expired at the end of the 2023 NFL season. The Maryland product had seen limited work with Pittsburgh in each of the past three seasons and will now have a new opportunity in Miami. His addition comes as fellow running back Chris Brooks was placed in concussion protocol. ", " Colt McCoy FAQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 1:21 PM McCoy retired from the NFL on Monday, Peter Schrager of FoxSports.com reports. Spin:The 14-year veteran quarterback is officially calling it a career after stints with the Browns, 49ers, Commanders, Giants and Cardinals. McCoy threw for 7,975 yards, 34 touchdowns and 32 interceptions across his 56 regular-season appearances. Now that McCoy has retired from the NFL, he's expected to land a high-profile broadcasting job that will be announced later today, per Schrager. ", " Braylon Sanders DolphinsWR Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 1:12 PM Sanders is considered week-to-week after sustaining a lower-body injury during Monday's practice session, Travis Wingfield of the Dolphins' official site reports. Spin:Sanders was expected to have an outside chance at making the Dolphins' 53-man roster, and this injury likely decreases his odds even further. Once Sanders is fully past this lower-body issue, he's expected to compete for a spot on Miami's practice squad for the second year in a row. ", " Chris Brooks DolphinsRB Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 1:06 PM Brooks entered concussion protocol after Monday's practice session, Travis Wingfield of the Dolphins' official site reports. Spin:The second-year running back out of BYU was likely on the outside looking in at Miami's 53-man roster, and this concussion further diminishes his chances. Once Brooks returns to the field, he's expected to compete for a depth role in the team's RB room or a spot on the Dolphins' practice squad. ", " Josh Allen BillsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 12:42 PM Coach Sean McDermott said Monday that Allen and the starters will not suit up for Saturday's preseason finale against the Panthers, Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic reports. Spin:Allen also sat out last weekend's 9-3 exhibition win over the Steelers, though McDermott initially said the plan for that game was for starters to play a quarter and a half. Now, McDermott says plans have changed due to team-wide injury considerations. Allen remains at 100 percent form and has avoided injuries throughout training camp, but wide receiver Curtis Samuel (turf toe) is considered week-to-week, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (neck) could miss multiple weeks, so it makes sense for Buffalo to prioritize health at this stage. ", " John Wolford BuccaneersQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 12:16 PM Wolford (ribs) practiced Monday, Greg Auman of Fox Sports reports. Spin:Wolford left in the fourth quarter of Saturday's exhibition loss to the Jaguars after taking a hit that resulted in a roughing the passer call. The Wake Forest product's return to the field Monday will help keep him in the running for the No. 2 role at QB behind Baker Mayfield, although Kyle Trask is considered the frontrunner for the job. ", " Joshua Dobbs 49ersQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 11:36 AM Dobbs may be the frontrunner to back up Brock Purdy in San Francisco after his performance in a 16-10 win over the Saints on Sunday, Kevin Patra of the team's official site reports. Spin:Dobbs led the 49ers on three scoring drives while completing 12 of his 21 passing attempts for 133 yards, and also ran the ball three times for 25 yards and a touchdown. The Tennessee product is considered to be competing with Brandon Allen for the job, with head coach Kyle Shannahan not tipping his hand, stating, \"Dobbs got to play a little bit more and I thought he did a real good job leading on some of those drives. When Brandon came in, he did the same. It was very similar to last week. The games have been tight, the practices have been tight. So, it's a good problem we have right now.\" ", " Michael Mayer RaidersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 10:26 AM Mayer caught three of his four targets for 16 yards in Saturday's 27-12 preseason loss to the Cowboys. Spin:As a rookie, Mayer -- whom the Raiders took in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft -- recorded a 27-304-2 line on 40 targets in 14 regular-season games. Following his initial campaign as a pro, it looked like the Notre Dame product would be in a position to see a significant uptick in volume in Year 2, but when the Raiders selected fellow tight end Brock Bowers 13th overall this April, that scenario became far less likely. That said, while playing alongside Bowers hampers Mayer's weekly fantasy upside, he could still merit attention in TE-friendly formats, with Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com noting that Las Vegas' Gardner Minshew-helmed offense figures to feature a lot of multiple tight end sets. ", " Patrick Mahomes ChiefsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:57 AM Coach Andy Reid said Monday that Mahomes and other starters are unlikely to play in Thursday's preseason game against Chicago, Sam McDowell of The Kansas City Star reports. Spin:Mahomes played the first two preseason games and completed 11 of 18 passes for 120 yards, with highlights including a 37-yard completion to rookie Xavier Worthy during Saturday's loss to the Lions. Marquise Brown's health is perhaps the biggest question for Kansas City's offense ahead of a Week 1 home game against the Ravens after the wideout suffered a sternoclavicular injury Aug. 10. A recovery timeline of 4-to-6 weeks was reported shortly thereafter, putting Brown in serious doubt for the Week 1 rematch of last season's AFC Championship Game. ", " Braxton Berrios DolphinsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:51 AM Berrios (undisclosed) did not secure either of his two targets during Saturday's 13-6 preseason win over the Commanders. Spin:Berrios didn't do much in the receiving game, but he did return two kickoffs for 41 yards (20 and 21 yards each). His lone punt return was a fair catch. Rookie sixth-round pick Malik Washington was also involved in the return game, as he brought back five punts for 35 yards. Berrios missed time due to an undisclosed injury earlier in training camp but is now demonstrably healthy. ", " Greg Joseph PackersK News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:38 AM Joseph missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt in Sunday's preseason game against the Broncos. Spin:Joseph was the only Packers kicker to record an attempt Sunday with Green Bay's offense unable to get much going, and he was unable to convert his lone chance. Joseph and Anders Carlson remain the primary competitors for the placekicking job in Green Bay. ", " Bo Melton PackersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:32 AM Melton was targeted three times and caught two passes for 10 yards in Sunday's preseason game against the Broncos. Spin:Melton garnered a start Sunday with the Packers holding out their top four wideouts, and he secured two of the three passes thrown his direction. Melton likely has a roster spot locked up thanks to his performance late last season, but barring an injury to a fellow pass catcher, he will be no higher than the fifth option at his position. ", " Devin Duvernay JaguarsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:30 AM Duvernay caught his lone target for 15 yards during Saturday's preseason game against the Buccaneers. Spin:Duvernay joined the Jaguars on a two-year, $8.5 million contract in March and is expected to serve as their primary return man in 2024. The 26-year-old totaled 880 receiving yards and five touchdowns with Baltimore from 2020 to 2022, but he recorded just four catches for 18 yards last season before hitting free agency. Duvernay isn't likely to be consistently involved in Jacksonville's passing game this year and is competing with Parker Washington for the No. 4 spot on the depth chart. ", " Samori Toure PackersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:25 AM Toure was targeted twice and caught two passes for 17 yards in Sunday's preseason game against the Broncos. Spin:Toure tallied a reception, a carry and two punt returns in the first game of the exhibition season, and he tacked on two more catches Sunday. He remains in the mix for a roster spot, but he occupies no higher than the seventh spot on the depth chart. ", " Ben Sims PackersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 9:22 AM Sims caught one pass for 10 yards in Sunday's preseason game against the Broncos. Spin:After being blanked in Green Bay's first exhibition contest, Sims made at least a minor mark in his next opportunity. He sits third on the depth chart at his position with one preseason game to go. ", " Deuce Vaughn CowboysRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:56 AM Vaughn carried the ball five times for 34 yards in Saturday's preseason game against the Raiders. He also returned one kickoff for 25 yards. Spin:The undersized back looked good in his first exhibition action after missing the Cowboys' preseason opener due to a hamstring injury. Vaughn led all Dallas backs in rushing yards and showed some surprising power through contact in addition to his usual elusiveness. The 2023 sixth-round pick is fighting for a depth spot behind Ezekiel Elliott and Rico Dowdle in the backfield, and his ability to contribute on special teams could help him secure a spot on the game-day roster. ", " Christian Kirk JaguarsWR Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:49 AM Coach Doug Pederson said Kirk (calf) won't practice this week, Demetrius Harvey of The Florida Times-Union reports. Spin:This will be Kirk's second week of missed practice since suffering a calf injury that Pederson described as mild. The 27-year-old played in Jacksonville's preseason opener and still has nearly three weeks to get healthy before the regular-season opener (Sept. 8 at Miami). ", " D'Ernest Johnson JaguarsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:47 AM Johnson carried three times for 12 yards and caught his lone target for nine yards during Saturday's preseason game against the Buccaneers. Spin:The 28-year-old re-signed with Jacksonville on a one-year deal in the spring and has eight carries for 43 yards and two receptions for 32 yards through two preseason games. Starter Travis Etienne sat out Saturday's contest, and Tank Bigsby instead started the game and appears to be the favorite for the backup job. Johnson totaled 41 carries for 108 yards and 10 receptions for 140 yards last season, and he's unlikely to be more involved in 2024, if he even makes the season-opening roster. ", " Brandon Aubrey CowboysK News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:41 AM Aubrey converted both his field-goal attempts and all three of his extra-point tries in Saturday's preseason game against the Raiders, including a 66-yard FG just before halftime. Spin:Had it been the regular season, that kick from the Cowboys' side of midfield would have tied for the longest field goal in NFL history, matching the record set by Justin Tucker in 2021. Aubrey established himself as one of the best placekickers in the league as a rookie in 2023, and the 29-year-old shows no signs of becoming a one-year wonder. ", " Jacob Cowing 49ersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 8:29 AM Cowing caught four of five targets for 51 yards and took a carry for 19 yards in Sunday's 16-10 preseason win over the Saints. Spin:Cowing got extensive playing time in the second and third quarters, highlighted by a 39-yard gain on a deep pass down the sideline shortly before halftime. Four of his five touches produced first downs, with the fifth being a five-yard loss on a screen pass where he unsuccessfully reversed field on a blown-up play. It was a nice performance, but the rookie fourth-round pick probably won't get much playing time early in the season even if the Niners fail to work out a contract with Brandon Aiyuk. ", " Cedrick Wilson Jr. SaintsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:49 AM Wilson started Sunday's preseason game against the 49ers and caught one of two targets for five yards. Spin:Wilson and Chris Olave got most of the first-team snaps at wide receiver, with the former filling in for Rashid Shaheed (hamstring). It's a decent indication that Wilson is on track for the third or fourth spot on the depth chart, but he probably won't see a lot of targets even if he's on the field a good amount. ", " Trayveon Williams BengalsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:32 AM Williams had six carries for 22 yards and two catches for 19 yards in a preseason loss to the Bears on Saturday. Spin:Williams got the start with Zack Moss and Chase Brown among the many Bengals rested. There's not much fantasy appeal to a 2019 sixth-round pick who has mostly played special teams to this point in his career, but Williams at least appears on track for a back-end roster spot after fellow running back Chris Evans suffered a season-ending knee injury a few days earlier. ", " John Bates CommandersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:24 AM Bates caught both of his targets for 20 yards in Saturday's 13-6 preseason loss to Miami. Spin:Both receptions came from QB Jayden Daniels, with Bates making the start and playing nearly all the first-team snaps for a second straight week. The fourth-year pro is unlikely to have an every-down role once the regular season begins, but it does seem Bates will start the year ahead of rookie second-round pick Ben Sinnott, serving as the blocking/inline tight end in a timeshare with Zach Ertz. It may not be long before Sinnott pushes for more snaps, however. ", " Olamide Zaccheaus CommandersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:22 AM Zaccheaus caught two of four targets for nine yards in a 13-6 preseason loss to the Dolphins on Saturday. Spin:Zaccheaus got some playing time with the first-team offense, but he wasn't a starter and saw just one of his four targets from QB Jayden Daniels. Meanwhile, Dyami Brown caught three passes for 19 yards on the opening drive, and Jahan Dotson took most of the slot snaps with the starters. Dotson, Brown, Zaccheaus and Luke McCaffrey are competing for playing time behind locked-in No. 1 receiver Terry McLaurin, with Commanders coach Dan Quinn having recently hinted that the No. 2 and 3 roles are up for grabs. Dotson appears likely to take one of the spots, and it's possible the other starts off as a rotation between Brown and Zaccheaus. ", " Dyami Brown CommandersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:18 AM Brown started Saturday's preseason game against Miami and caught each of his three targets for 19 yards. Spin:All three receptions came from QB Jayden Daniels on the opening drive, but Brown rotated with Olamide Zaccheaus while Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson played nearly all the first-team snaps. Coach Dan Quinn suggested all the roles are up for grabs behind McLaurin, leaving Dotson, Brown, Zaccheaus and Luke McCaffrey to compete for playing time. Brown has done well this preseason with five catches for 74 yards on six targets, but he might end up in a rotation even if he's a Week 1 starter for the first time since his 2021 rookie season. ", " Dawson Knox BillsTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 7:02 AM Knox (groin) played in Saturday's preseason game against Pittsburgh and caught his lone target for a nine-yard gain. Spin:Knox and Dalton Kincaid both started, alongside RB James Cook and WRs Keon Coleman and Mack Hollins. Kincaid was removed from the game after two snaps, and Knox didn't stay in much longer (six snaps) before handing things over to No. 3 TE Quintin Morris, who then left with a shoulder injury. Groin and ankle injuries have cost Knox some practice time this summer, but he's been available more often than not. ", " Hunter Henry PatriotsTE Questionable News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 6:44 AM Coach Jerod Mayo expects Henry (undisclosed) and the Patriots' other injured tight ends to be \"ready to go relatively early in the season,\" Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Henry was held out of Thursday's preseason loss to the Eagles, while fellow tight ends Austin Hooper (undisclosed) and Mitchell Wilcox (calf) both played but now are dealing with injuries. Previous reports suggested Henry's issue isn't serious, but it isn't clear when he's expected to rejoin practice. August 18 Hunter Long RamsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 11:34 PM Long failed to bring in either of his two targets during Saturday's 13-9 victory against the Chargers. Spin:The battle to start the season as the No. 2 tight end behind Colby Parkinson while Tyler Higbee (knee) remains on the mend, seems to be leaning toward Davis Allen. Long hasn't done anything to make himself stand out over the second-year pro, and Allen showed enough when called upon in the latter half of the 2023 campaign to secure a roster spot. Long will likely be the tertiary option at tight end to start the year unless he breaks out in a big way against the Texans in the Rams' preseason finale, and he will likely struggle to find snaps on offense even before Higbee's eventual return. ", " Davis Allen RamsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 11:25 PM Allen secured two of four targets for 11 yards during Saturday's 13-9 victory against the Chargers. Spin:The second-year tight end out of Clemson was used sparingly in the contest, as were all of the Rams' tight ends. Colby Parkinson notably did not take the field for the second straight game, meaning he'll likely be the starter during Tyler Higbee's (knee) absence. Allen and Hunter Long are in a competition to be No. 2 on the depth chart at the start of the season, but Long has failed to bring in a target through two preseason games. The duo's final chance to make their case will come against the Texans in a preseason Week 3 tilt. ", " Taysom Hill SaintsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 11:10 PM Hill rushed five times for 21 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 16-10 loss to the 49ers. Spin:Hill has already proved himself worthy as both a quarterback and a tight end, but he appears to be putting a focus being a runner this year. On top of taking carries as a tailback Sunday, the 34-year-old also served as a lead blocker while lined up as a fullback during the first three offensive series as well. This included his one-yard rushing touchdown on a fullback dive early in the second quarter. Gaining more roster flexibility is generally received well in fantasy, so Hill should be able to carve out a niche role for certain managers this campaign. ", " Joshua Karty RamsK News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 10:59 PM Karty made two of three field goal attempts and converted his only PAT during Saturday's 13-9 victory against the Chargers. Spin:Karty's miss from 52 yards shouldn't be too concerning, as the Rams' rookie kicker still managed to boot field goals from 48 and 43 yards, respectively. The Stanford product has officially won the starting kicking job, as Tanner Brown was released by Rams earlier this week. Karty has been solid through two preseason contests, making 4-of-5 field-goal attempts and both of his extra point tries. Karty will get one last chance to get acclimated in a preseason Week 3 showdown with the Texans. ", " A.T. Perry SaintsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 10:13 PM Perry (ankle) had two receptions (on six targets) for 24 yards in Sunday's 16-10 loss to the 49ers. Spin:Perry got all of his targets in the second half while playing with backups, but it was a positive sign to see the receiver back in action after suffering an ankle injury in the Saints' preseason opener. His standing on the depth chart is unclear, and it's not exactly encouraging that he didn't get first-team snaps on a night when Rashid Shaheed (hamstring) was unavailable. Journeyman vet Cedrick Wilson joined Chris Olave as the regular WR pairing for the first-team offense. ", " Nick Muse VikingsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:49 PM Muse had three receptions for 19 yards on three targets in Saturday's preseason win over Cleveland. Spin:Muse appears set to win a roster spot with Robert Tonyan still out with a back injury. Muse could factor into the offense early in the season as a second or third receiving tight end if T.J. Hockenson misses games while working his way back from a torn ACL. ", " Jalen Nailor VikingsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:45 PM Nailor had one reception for 31 yards on two targets in Saturday's preseason win over Cleveland. Spin:Nailor started at outside receiver and played just 19 snaps as the Vikings rested most of their starting offense. He built upon an impressive first preseason game and has a strong hold on the No. 3 receiver job at this point in the preseason over Brandon Powell. The No. 3 receiver role could have significant fantasy value with tight end T.J. Hockenson set to miss several games coming back from a torn ACL and Jordan Addison facing a potential suspension for a DUI charge. ", " Adam Trautman BroncosTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:42 PM Trautman caught one of two targets for eight yards in Sunday's 27-2 preseason win over the Packers. Spin:Trautman caught the first pass thrown by quarterback Bo Nix on the opening drive. Due to Trautman's blocking prowess, he is the favorite to lead Denver's tight ends in playing time during the 2024 regular season, though Greg Dulcich and Lucas Krull both have higher ceilings as pass catchers. Dulcich caught both of his targets for 27 yards in Sunday's win, while Krull finished with two catches for six yards on three targets. ", " Courtland Sutton BroncosWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:35 PM Sutton caught his only target for 23 yards in Sunday's 27-2 preseason win over the Packers. Spin:Sutton's lone contribution came on the team's second drive, as rookie quarterback Bo Nix connected with the veteran wide receiver to get down to the four-yard line. Nix threw a touchdown pass to Tim Patrick two plays later. Sutton's set to operate as the top target for whomever plays under center for the Broncos come the regular season, and he's unlikely to get significant playing time in next Sunday's preseason finale against the Cardinals. While Nix has yet to be officially named the starter for Week 1, all signs seem to be pointing that way given how well the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft has played in the preseason. ", " Chase McLaughlin BuccaneersK News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:32 PM McLaughlin missed his only field-goal attempt, from 42 yards out, and made his sole extra-point try in the Buccaneers' 20-7 preseason loss to the Jaguars on Saturday night. Spin:That's two misses in as many preseason contests for McLaughlin, who parlayed a career-best 93.5 percent success rate on field-goal attempts across 17 regular-season games in 2023 to score a three-year extension this offseason. McLaughlin doesn't have any competition on the roster and could well just be working through some kinks, but an unblemished performance in the exhibition finale against the Dolphins on Friday night would certainly build some confidence. ", " Jaleel McLaughlin BroncosRB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:29 PM McLaughlin rushed three times for 17 yards and caught his only target for four yards in Sunday's 27-2 preseason win over the Packers. Spin:McLaughlin was the second running back into the game for Denver after Javonte Williams, working ahead of Audric Estime and Samaje Perine. He handled only four touches in this game after logging nine in the preseason opener against the Colts. McLaughlin is seemingly locked in as Williams' top backup, so it's possible neither of them will play much in next Sunday's preseason finale against the Cardinals as Denver sorts out the rest of its backfield depth chart. ", " Michael Pratt PackersQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:24 PM Pratt completed 10 of 16 passes for 52 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's 27-2 preseason loss to the Broncos. He added one rushing attempt for seven yards. Spin:Sean Clifford started and played the first four drives before Pratt handled the remainder of the game. Neither reserve quarterback led the offense to any points, suggesting that the status quo of Clifford occupying the second spot on the depth chart behind Jordan Love remains intact heading into Green Bay's preseason finale against the Ravens on Saturday. ", " Jamaal Williams SaintsRB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:24 PM Williams rushed five times for 32 yards and caught his lone target for two yards in Sunday's preseason tilt against San Francisco. Spin:Williams continues to start for the Saints while Alvin Kamara (back) heals in anticipation of the regular season. The latter is currently not in jeopardy of missing any meaningful time, so fantasy managers shouldn't fret over the lingering injury designation. That said, it wouldn't hurt to target Williams if you have shares of Kamara, roster space permitting. Williams has produced in a starting role before, but the veteran would struggle to reach the amount of touches required if Kamara is ready to roll come Week 1. ", " Sean Clifford PackersQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:21 PM Clifford started Sunday's 27-2 preseason loss to the Broncos and completed six of 10 passes for 43 yards, no touchdowns and one interception. He also rushed once for 11 yards. Spin:With Jordan Love getting the night off in Green Bay's second preseason game, Clifford struggled during his four drives in the game, which included an incomplete pass on fourth down to end the opening drive and an interception on Clifford's final throw of the night. Michael Pratt threw for only 52 yards in the remainder of the game, and the team's only points came from the defense courtesy of a safety, so Clifford remains the favorite for the second spot on the quarterback depth chart behind Love heading into the Packers' final preseason game against the Ravens on Saturday. ", " Tim Patrick BroncosWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:20 PM Patrick caught all four of his targets for 30 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 27-2 preseason win over the Packers. Spin:All of Patrick's production came in two drives alongside rookie quarterback Bo Nix to start the game. Patrick accounted for half of Nix's eight completions, including a two-yard touchdown to cap both players' time in the game, which marked Patrick's first trip to the end zone in an NFL game since Week 15 of the 2021 season. Patrick finally looks healthy after missing the last two seasons due to a torn ACL followed by a torn Achilles, and he has a chance to carve out a prominent role in a Broncos receiving corps with an unsettled depth chart behind No. 1 receiver Courtland Sutton. Patrick's budding chemistry with Nix is encouraging considering Nix is the favorite to start the majority of Denver's games at quarterback in 2024. ", " Cody Thompson BuccaneersWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:42 PM Thompson secured five of six targets for 66 yards and a touchdown and rushed twice for 12 yards in the Buccaneers' 20-7 preseason loss to the Jaguars on Saturday night. Spin:Thompson has appeared in 12 regular-season games for the Seahawks since making his pro debut in 2021, but he has all of one catch to show for it. However, he's making a solid case in his long-shot bid for a roster spot with the Buccaneers, following up his 3-26-0 line on four targets in the exhibition opener against the Bengals by either tying for or owning the team lead in receptions, receiving yards and targets Saturday night. Thompson also scored the only points of the night for Tampa Bay's offense on his six-yard touchdown grab late in the second quarter, and he could give head coach Todd Bowles and his staff a tough decision come final cuts if he continues his strong play in Friday night's preseason finale against the Dolphins. ", " Jauan Jennings 49ersWR Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:40 PM Jennings didn't play in Sunday's 16-10 preseason win over the Saints due to an oblique injury, Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area reports. Spin:Maiocco adds that Jennings isn't expected to miss much time due to the injury. While Jenning's status for the 49ers' preseason finale against the Raiders on Friday is uncertain, he doesn't seem to be in jeopardy of missing the Sept. 9 regular-season opener against the Jets. ", " Dallin Holker SaintsTE Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:33 PM Coach Dennis Allen revealed after Sunday's 16-10 preseason loss to the 49ers that Holker sprained his ankle in pregame warmups, John Hendrix of Sports Illustrated reports. Spin:It was previously reported that Holker sustained an injury in warmups, and Allen clarified the nature of the rookie tight end's issue. Holker will try to recover in time to suit up for New Orleans' preseason finale against the Titans on Sunday, Aug. 25. ", " Kyle Trask BuccaneersQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:33 PM Trask completed 12 of 19 passes for 108 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions and rushed once for four yards in the Buccaneers' 20-7 preseason loss to the Jaguars on Saturday night. Spin:Trask led the Buccaneers' only scoring drive of the night, a nine-play, 68-yard march he capped off with a six-yard touchdown pass to Cody Thompson. With his first-half performance, the third-year quarterback appears to have gotten a leg up on fellow signal-caller John Wolford (ribs) in the battle for the No. 2 job, and the latter's injury, which forced a fourth-quarter exit Saturday, arguably tips the job battle in Trask's favor all the more. ", " Jordan Whittington RamsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 5:49 PM Whittington secured five of eight targets for 52 yards during Saturday's 13-9 victory against the Chargers. Spin:Despite playing in just 36 of the Rams' 63 snaps on offense, Whittington led the team in receiving yards and was tied with Xavier Smith (who played 59 snaps) for targets and receptions. The rookie out of Texas has been solid through two preseason games with an 11-126-0 line over 82 snaps on offense. Head coach Sean McVay generally keeps his starters on the bench through the preseason, but Whittington may simply be on the field to get some valuable reps in before his rookie campaign begins. While Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp will start the year as the top two wideouts for the Rams, who will be their No. 3 wideout is less defined. Demarcus Robinson and Tutu Atwell have been vying for the role, but Whittington could easily make a case for the position if his preseason performances continue to impress. ", " Equanimeous St. Brown SaintsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 4:35 PM St. Brown (hamstring) is dressed for Sunday's preseason game against the 49ers, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football reports. Spin:St. Brown is ready to make his Saints debut after sitting out the preseason opener against the Cardinals. The 27-year-old wide receiver is battling for a roster spot in New Orleans, so it's encouraging that he has finally recovered from a hamstring injury that has hampered him throughout training camp. ", " Josh Whyle TitansTE Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 4:16 PM Head coach Brian Callahan said Sunday that Whyle remains in concussion protocol but could return to practice later in the week, Jim Wyatt of the Titans' official site reports. Spin:It's not clear when Whyle sustained the concussion, as he did not suit up for the Titans' 16-15 win over the Seahawks on Saturday. Whyle is competing against Nick Vannett and Thomas Odukoya for the backup tight end job behind starter Chigoziem Okonkwo. ", " Will Levis TitansQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 3:05 PM Titans coach Brian Callahan said Sunday that he's currently planning for the team's starters, which should include Levis, to play in the preseason finale versus New Orleans on Sunday, Aug. 25, Jim Wyatt of the team's official site reports. Spin:Callahan added that he'd \"like to see our starting offense play somewhere in the 3-ish series\" against the Saints, per Wyatt. Levis played the first two drives of Tennessee's preseason opener and then was held out along with a group of the team's key starters in Saturday's exhibition against Seattle. ", " Malik Taylor JetsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 2:26 PM The Jets placed Taylor on injured reserve with an undisclosed issue Sunday, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports. Spin:Taylor sustained an injury at an early point in training camp, according to Ethan Greenberg of the team's official site, though it's unclear exactly when or how this issue arose. The 28-year-old wideout appeared in three games while on the practice squad last year, securing two of four targets for 13 yards. Taylor previously looked like he had a solid chance to earn a spot on the final 53-man roster, but he'll now be forced to sit out the entire 2024 campaign unless he's let go from IR with an injury settlement. ", " James Washington FAWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 1:36 PM The Falcons released Washington on Sunday. Spin:Washington was let go as part of a corresponding move to make space for recently acquired safety Justin Simmons on the Falcons' 90-man offseason roster. The 28-year-old wideout last played with the Cowboys during the 2022 season, when he appeared in just two games after fracturing his foot during training camp. Washington bounced around a few teams last offseason, but he went unsigned throughout the 2023 campaign and joined the Falcons on July 29, He'll now look for an comeback opportunity elsewhere this preseason. ", " Dameon Pierce TexansRB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 12:42 PM Pierce started and gained five yards on four carries in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. He also returned one kickoff for 18 yards. Spin:Pierce got a second straight preseason start and played the first quarter with Joe Mixon not suiting up. Mixon, who opened camp with a quadriceps injury, returned to practice last week but was held out Saturday. The running back rotation following Pierce was Dare Ogunbowale, Cam Akers, J.J. Taylor and then Jawhar Jordan. ", " Cade Stover TexansTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 12:32 PM Stover was targeted once in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. Spin:Stover had a quiet afternoon after shining a week ago. He and Dalton Keene played 22 snaps behind the top two tight ends, Dalton Schultz and Brevin Jordan. Stover and Keene are angling for the third spot on the depth chart, while Teagan Quitoriano (calf) has been unavailable. ", " Xavier Hutchinson TexansWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 12:24 PM Hutchinson caught two-of-four targets for 20 yards in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. Spin:Following a strong showing in the Hall of Fame Game, Hutchinson put together a pair of mediocre outings the subsequent two weeks. He may have entered the game as the leader for the fifth spot on the wideout depth chart, but his main competitor, John Metchie, had a strong game with six catches for 68 yards and a touchdown. ", " Austin Hooper PatriotsTE Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 11:30 AM Hooper (undisclosed) didn't practice Sunday, Mark Daniels of MassLive.com reports. Spin:Hooper suffered an injury during practice Saturday, per Phil Perry of NBC Sports Boston. The Patriots' tight-end room is now dealing with injuries to each of its top three options, as Hunter Henry also sat out Sunday due to an undisclosed issue and Mitchell Wilcox departed early with an injury. Rookie Jaheim Bell consequently ended up with increased reps during the session. ", " John Metchie III TexansWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 11:09 AM Metchie caught six of seven targets for 68 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. Spin:Metchie had a couple of meh showings in the Hall of Fame Game and first preseason tilt, disappointing head coach DeMeco Ryans, but he responded Saturday. Metchie led the team in targets, receptions and yards as he positioned himself behind the team's top three wideouts. He's competing against Noah Brown (shoulder), Xavier Hutchinson (two of four targets, 20 yards), Steven Sims (two of two, 20 yards), Ben Skowronek (leg) and Robert Woods (zero targets, 13 snaps) for the back end of the wide receiver depth chart. ", " Kearis Jackson TitansWR Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 10:57 AM Jackson (knee) is questionable for the Titans' last preseason game at New Orleans, Jim Wyatt of the Titans' official site reports. Spin:Jackson sustained a bruised knee during Saturday's preseason game versus the Seahawks, and now it looks like that injury could keep him out for the rest of the preseason. If he is indeed out, undrafted rookie free agent Sam Schnee could see an uptick in reps. ", " Kyle Philips TitansWR Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 10:50 AM Philips (hamstring) is unlikely to play in the Titans' preseason finale at the Saints, Jim Wyatt of the Titans' official site reports. Spin:Phillips has been sitting out of practices with a lingering hamstring injury, and now it looks like it could keep him out until at least the regular season. It's no sure thing that he'll make Tennessee's final 53-man roster, though, and players like Sam Schnee may get more opportunities to make an impression if Philips is out. ", " Dustin Hopkins BrownsK Questionable News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 10:26 AM Cleveland head coach Kevin Stefanski said Saturday that Hopkins is dealing with a minor injury but will be ready for the regular season, Zac Jackson of The Athletic reports. Spin:With Hopkins expected to be available Week 1, fantasy managers should read nothing into Cade York handling the kicking chores the first two preseason games. Using York could also be a showcase for a potential trade suitor later this summer. ", " Jaelon Darden BrownsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:59 AM Darden caught two of four targets for 21 yards in Saturday's preseason game against Minnesota. He also returned two punts for 16 yards and one kickoff for 29 yards. Spin:All of Darden's activity as a receiver occurred during the second half. If he's to stick with the team, it will likely be as a returner. Darden has returned both punts and kickoffs in each of the first two preseason games. ", " Laviska Shenault Jr. SeahawksWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:37 AM Shenault caught all three of his targets for 27 yards and rushed once for five yards in Saturday's 16-15 preseason loss to the Titans. Spin:Shenault has performed well as a gadget player, and while he didn't return a kickoff this week, he already proved he's an option in that facet during the first preseason matchup. The 25-year-old receiver appears to have the edge over Dee Eskridge (undisclosed) for the No. 5 wide receiver role. Shenault could handle some designed touches during the regular season if he does secure that role. ", " Allen Lazard JetsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:37 AM Lazard didn't play in Saturday's 15-12 preseason win over the Panthers. Spin:Lazard is among numerous offensive players who have sat out the Jets' first two preseason games. Despite mustering a meager 311 receiving yards in 2023, he's a lock to make the team in 2024, and the 28-year-old wide receiver is hoping that the return of Aaron Rodgers under center will elevate the entire offense. Garrett Wilson and Mike Williams (knee) are projected to open the season as starters on the outside with Lazard -- who had 788 yards and six touchdowns with Rodgers as his quarterback in Green Bay in 2022 -- in a bench role. ", " Easop Winston Jr. SeahawksWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:28 AM Winston caught three of four targets for 47 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 16-15 preseason loss to the Titans. Spin:Winston started the game and scored on a 23-yard go route from Sam Howell in the first quarter. The 27-year-old now has 77 yards through two preseason games, the most of any Seahawks receiver. Winston is making a good case to earn one of the final roster spots, and his usage as a punt returner works in his favor, too. ", " Jordan Akins BrownsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 9:12 AM Akins caught both of his targets for 15 yards in Saturday's preseason game against Minnesota. Spin:Akins has played the first quarters of both preseason games and caught all four targets for 40 yards. He's expected to serve as the top backup to David Njoku, while Zaire Mitchell-Paden and Giovanni Ricci (knee) battle for the third spot. ", " Tyler Huntley BrownsQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:43 AM Huntley completed 14 of 20 passes for 135 yards with two interceptions in Saturday's preseason game against the Vikings. He also gained 19 yards on four carries. Spin:Huntley, who ended up leading the club in rushing yards, spent most of the time scrambling, as the Browns sustained multiple injuries along the offensive line. He played the second half after Dorian Thompson-Robinson opened the game, and the two are locked in a battle for the No. 3 job, per Zac Jackson of The Athletic. The Browns like Huntley's ability to scramble and extend plays, but he was forced to run too much Saturday. ", " Nate Sudfeld LionsQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 8:09 AM Sudfeld completed 14 of 27 passes for 196 yards and a touchdown while also throwing an interception in Saturday's 24-23 win over Kansas City. Spin:Sudfeld drew the start for the second straight contest at quarterback, playing 37 snaps in the victory. The 30-year-old and Hendon Hooker are vying for the top backup spot behind Jared Goff this season, and, as of right now, Sudfeld feels like he may have the slightest edge. Hooker played 40 snaps, recording 150 passing yards, 11 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown versus Kansas City. The two quarterbacks will have one more chance to prove themselves in Detroit's final preseason game Saturday at home against the Steelers. ", " Michael Penix Jr. FalconsQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 7:52 AM Penix is expected to be held out of Atlanta's final exhibition game against Jacksonville on Friday, Marc Raimondi of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Penix also didn't play in the Falcons' second preseason contest versus Baltimore on Saturday. Head coach Raheem Morris explained that the team feels it \"saw enough last week [in Atlanta's preseason opener] of him and the live stuff,\" adding that \"[Penix] showed us last week enough that we don't have to play him in the preseason.\" The rookie QB completed nine of 16 passes for 104 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions against Miami in Atlanta's first game of the preseason and is slated to open the regular season as the team's backup behind Kirk Cousins. ", " MyCole Pruitt SteelersTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 7:29 AM Pruitt secured his lone target for eight yards during Saturday's 9-3 preseason loss to the Bills. Spin:Pruitt wasn't targeted during the Steelers' preseason opener against Houston last weekend, but he recorded a catch during Saturday's low-scoring loss. He played 32 percent of the team's offensive snaps Saturday, but if he makes the 53-man roster, he's unlikely to see much playing time behind Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington. ", " Quez Watkins SteelersWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 18, 7:26 AM Watkins failed to secure his lone target while rushing once for six yards during Saturday's 9-3 preseason loss to the Bills. Spin:Watkins was on the field for 53 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps Saturday, but he didn't see many touches during the low-scoring loss. He didn't have any offensive touches during last weekend's preseason opener, and he could have to put together a productive outing during next Saturday's preseason finale against Detroit to bolster his case for a spot on the 53-man roster. August 17 Julius Chestnut TitansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:52 PM Chestnut rushed the ball 13 times for 45 yards in Saturday's 16-15 preseason win over the Seahawks. He added two receptions (on two targets) for 29 yards. Spin:The Titans sat both Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears, leaving Hassan Haskins and Chestnut as the top backs available. Chestnut was utilized as the starter and carried a heavy workload. The majority of his yardage came on a 22-yard rush late in the second quarter, though he also led off the team's first possession with a 15-yard reception. Chestnut could begin the season third on the running back depth chart, but that won't translate to much work out of the backfield. ", " Mason Rudolph TitansQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:42 PM Rudolph completed 10 of 17 passes for 125 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions in Saturday's 16-15 preseason win over the Seahawks. He added four rushes for 15 yards. Spin:Rudolph entered the game after Malik Willis, with his first drive coming with five minutes left in the second quarter. He immediately led a touchdown march, during which he went 3-for-4 for 40 yards. Rudolph and Willis are competing for the backup job, though the former appears to be the favorite for the role to begin the regular season. ", " Malik Willis TitansQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:36 PM Willis completed 12 of 16 passes for 116 yards, no touchdowns and one interception in Saturday's 16-15 preseason win over the Seahawks. He added four rushes for 30 yards. Spin:The Titans sat Will Levis for the game, leaving Willis in line for the start over Mason Rudolph. Willis had several strong throws, highlighted by gains of 24 and 14 yards. Unsurprisingly, he was able to supplement that with his work on the ground, also chipping in an 11-yard rush. Willis is competing with Rudolph for the backup job to begin the regular season, and the former's current standing with the team remains unclear. ", " Drew Ogletree ColtsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:31 PM Ogletree failed to bring in his lone target in Saturday's preseason win over the Cardinals. Spin:Ogletree was the first tight end targeted by fill-in starter Sam Ehlinger in Saturday's exhibition. Kylen Granson and Mo Alie-Cox did not suit up for this contest while Jelani Woods (toe) suffered a minor injury against Arizona. Ogletree figures to still be in the mix for an unsettled tight-end depth chart in Indianapolis this season. ", " Tyler Boyd TitansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:26 PM Boyd did not play in Saturday's 16-15 preseason win over the Seahawks. Spin:The Titans have opted to play their starters sparingly this preseason, as Will Levis has attempted only five passes. Boyd has yet to find the stat sheet as a result, but he should have a significant role in the offense, particularly so long as DeAndre Hopkins (knee) is sidelined. ", " Emari Demercado CardinalsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:24 PM Demercado (shoulder) had 10 carries for 24 yards and caught his lone target for nine yards in Saturday's preseason loss to the Colts. Spin:Demercado returned from a shoulder injury that held him out of last week's exhibition tilt. The sophomore tailback entered the game in the second quarter behind rookie Trey Benson (9-43-0), but it could have been the coaching staff easing Demercado off the shelf as opposed to a demotion from his projected No. 2 role behind James Conner. Next week's preseason finale should be telling based on how the backup RBs are deployed. ", " Sam Howell SeahawksQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:18 PM Howell completed 11 of 14 passes for 153 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions in Saturday's 16-15 preseason loss to the Titans. He added two rushes for 11 yards. Spin:The Seahawks have shown little interest in playing their starters this preseason, leaving Howell to handle the majority of the exhibition contests. He played a clean game Saturday and dropped a beautiful pass into the arms of Easop Winston late in the first quarter for a 23-yard touchdown. Geno Smith remains the clear starter in Seattle, but Howell has looked like a very serviceable backup. ", " Royce Freeman CowboysRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:15 PM Freeman (groin) rushed seven times for 32 yards in the Cowboys' 27-12 preseason win over the Raiders on Saturday night. Spin:Freeman was able to suit up after having suffered a groin injury earlier in the month, and he finished second in rushing yardage after coming into the game behind starter Malik Davis. Freeman should have a solid chance of securing the No. 3 running back job given his experience, as well as the fact Davis didn't exactly impress with his starting opportunity Saturday (five carries, 14 yards). ", " Ja'Tavion Sanders PanthersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:12 PM Sanders recorded two receptions on two targets for 22 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:The Panthers didn't play any of their starters in the contest, so the fact that Sanders was on the field doesn't necessarily bode well for his position on the depth chart to begin the season. That doesn't come as a particular surprise considering tight end is a demanding position to learn at the pro level, due to the combination of both blocking and pass-catching responsibilities. In the short term, Sanders managed his first receptions as a pro, a good first step in his quest to move up the depth chart. ", " Tre Tucker RaidersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:11 PM Tucker secured three of six targets for 66 yards and returned two punts for 48 yards in the Raiders' 27-12 preseason loss to the Cowboys on Saturday night. Spin:Tucker secured a game-long 48-yard grab from Gardner Minshew on the first play of the second possession, a drive that ended in a field goal. Tucker also contributed solid gains on his other two catches and rattled off a 43-yard punt return while also seeing a 29-yard runback erased by an illegal block. This comes after Tucker had a trio of chunk plays in the preseason opener against the Vikings, meaning the 2023 third-round pick appears poised for a sizable Year 2 leap if his summer performances are any indication. ", " Terrace Marshall Jr. PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:05 PM Marshall recorded two receptions (on three targets) for 14 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:The Panthers held out their top pass catchers, leaving Marshall among the first receivers to take the field. He made both of his catches on the team's second possession, the first of which helped the offense convert on third down. Marshall has yet to find his footing as a pro and is likely fighting for his roster spot this summer. ", " Alexander Mattison RaidersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:03 PM Mattison rushed five times for 15 yards and secured one of two targets for six yards in the Raiders' 27-12 preseason loss to the Cowboys on Saturday night. He also returned one kickoff for 23 yards. Spin:Mattison worked as the second running back in behind Zamir White, a hierarchy that's expected to be mirrored during the regular season. Mattison shouldn't need any additional reps to get ready for the regular season and will be a valuable complementary presence, so he's likely to sit out of the Raiders' preseason finale against the 49ers on Friday night. ", " Zach Evans RamsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:01 PM Evans gained 62 yards on 16 rushing attempts in Saturday's preseason win over the Chargers. Spin:Evans received the first running back touch for the Rams on Saturday, but he was far less efficient on a per-carry basis (3.9 yards) compared to veteran backup Boston Scott. The latter ripped off 55 yards on just 10 carries as the Rams rested the trio of RBs ahead Scott and Evans on LA's depth chart. Neither of the tailbacks competing for a remaining roster spot received a target in the exhibition win. ", " Jonathan Mingo PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:00 PM Mingo recorded one catch (on one target) for four yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:None of Diontae Johnson (groin), Xavier Legette or Adam Thielen suited up, which left Mingo as one of the starting receivers. The Panthers made a clear effort to get him the ball early, as he tallied a four-yard catch prior to having an 18-yard gain negated by an offensive pass interference penalty on the first drive. Mingo had a very disappointing rookie season in 2023, and he's likely to begin the new campaign as the team's fourth receiver. ", " Malachi Corley JetsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:53 PM Corley recorded two receptions (on two targets) for 10 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason win over the Panthers. Spin:The Jets sat all of their projected starters, leaving Corley to catch the team's first pass of the game from Andrew Peasley. Corley has had a solid exhibition season, tallying six catches for 37 yards while also working as one of the team's kick returners. Special teams could be the primary path for him to find the field at the start of the regular season, though Corley could challenge Xavier Gipson for snaps in the slot as the campaign progresses. ", " Kene Nwangwu VikingsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:49 PM Nwangwu had seven carries for 45 yards in Saturday's preseason win over Cleveland. Spin:Even with the Vikings resting almost all their starters, Nwangwu had a second impressive preseason performance. Nwangwu has had a role in the offense as the No. 3 running back in training camp and looks to have locked up the job at this point in the preseason. While he's not likely to get many carries behind Aaron Jones and Ty Chandler, Nwangwu at least looks like a viable option should the top two get hurt. However, it's not clear if he'll return kickoffs as he hasn't been used as a returner in either preseason game after having that role last season. ", " Myles Gaskin VikingsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:46 PM Gaskin had nine carries for 45 yards and two receptions for 10 yards in Saturday's preseason win over Cleveland. Spin:Gaskin showed he can be a steady veteran as a reserve running back, but he may face an uphill battle to win a roster spot. The Vikings are likely to keep just three running backs with Kene Nwangwu currently ahead of Gaskin on the depth chart. ", " Brandon Powell VikingsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:40 PM Powell had two receptions for 19 yards on two targets in Saturday's preseason win over Cleveland. Spin:It's hard to take too much away from a preseason game where the Vikings rested almost all their starters, but Jalen Nailor again outshined Powell in the competition for the third receiver role. Nailor had one reception for 31 yards on two targets after an impressive first preseason game where Powell did little. It looks like Nailor has a big lead for the third receiver role as a result. Whoever wins the job could have significant fantasy value early in the season with the Vikings possibly utilizing three-receiver sets more often, as tight end T.J. Hockenson is likely to miss several games as he recovers from January surgery on a torn ACL. ", " Pat Freiermuth SteelersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:36 PM Freiermuth recorded one reception (on one target) for 10 yards in Saturday's 9-3 preseason loss to the Bills. Spin:Freiermuth made his lone catch on Pittsburgh's second possession, as he was hit in the right flat by Russell Wilson for a modest gain. Though Freiermuth has had limited production in two preseason games, he currently has a strong chance to be the second-most targeted pass catcher in the offense come the regular season. ", " Malik Davis CowboysRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:30 PM Davis rushed five times for 14 yards and returned one kickoff for 14 yards in the Cowboys' 27-12 preseason win over the Raiders on Saturday night. Spin:Davis was the first Cowboys running back to log a touch with Ezekiel Elliott and Rico Dowdle sitting out, but he found limited success during his time on the field. Davis did not record any rush attempts or receptions last season after carrying 38 times for 161 yards and a touchdown and recording six receptions in his rookie 2022 campaign, and he's battling the likes of Deuce Vaughn and Royce Freeman for a reserve running back spot with one preseason game remaining. ", " Israel Abanikanda JetsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:23 PM Abanikanda rushed the ball six times for 29 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason win over the Panthers. Spin:Abanikanda was relatively efficient with his opportunity Saturday, highlighted by a 12-yard gain to kick off the second half. However, he entered the game after both Isaiah Davis and Braelon Allen for the second consecutive week, suggesting he is currently fourth on the running back depth chart. That leaves him with little projectable volume out of the backfield. ", " Isaiah Davis JetsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:14 PM Davis rushed the ball four times for 14 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason win over the Panthers. He added one reception (on one target) for zero yards. Spin:Davis looks to be third on the Jets' running back depth chart behind Breece Hall and Braelon Allen, though he did get the first reps out of the backfield Saturday. His biggest gain of the day came on his opening carry, which went for nine yards. Davis was a strong receiver in his final two years at South Dakota State, a skill set that could help him see the field occasionally on obvious passing downs once the regular season begins. ", " Matt Gay ColtsK News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:13 PM Gay missed field-goal attempts from 56 and 44 yards in Saturday's preseason win over Arizona. He converted all three extra-point attempts. Spin:Gay is just 1-for-4 in field-goal attempts in two preseason games, also missing a 36-yard attempt in the first exhibition. His only make is from 26 yards. We wouldn't be too worried about a miss longer than 50 yards, but Gay signed one of the largest contracts in the league for a kicker (four-year, $22.5 million deal) to be more reliable than he's shown in the preseason. ", " Braelon Allen JetsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:09 PM Allen rushed the ball eight times for 27 yards in Saturday's 15-12 preseason win over the Panthers. He added two catches (on four targets) for 12 yards. Spin:Allen has drawn praise throughout training camp for his physical running style, and the team has also talked up his potential as a pass catcher. He didn't show much ability as a receiver during his collegiate career at Wisconsin, but he was heavily involved in that role Saturday with mixed results. Allen has seemingly all but locked in the second spot on the running back depth chart behind Breece Hall, though Isaiah Davis did get the first rushing attempt in Saturday's contest. ", " Jaret Patterson ChargersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:38 PM Patterson had four carries for 10 yards while catching all five of his targets for 28 yards in Saturday's 13-9 preseason loss to the Rams. Spin:Patterson was the first back deployed by the Chargers sans J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards while the projected top duo continues to sit until the regular season. Rookie Kimani Vidal (11-49-0) had a strong showing Saturday as both young backs continue to battle for spots and roles behind the aforementioned veteran transplants from Baltimore. Expect Patterson to see more work in the Chargers' final preseason tilt against the Cowboys next Saturday. ", " Wan'Dale Robinson GiantsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:34 PM Robinson caught his only target for 13 yards Saturday in an exhibition loss to the Texans. Spin:Darius Slayton and Malik Nabers were the Giants' top receivers with 59 and 54 yards, respectively, Saturday, and that duo figures to lead the team's receiver corps throughout the campaign. However, Robinson could still see plenty of opportunities as a slot and possession receiver, with his fantasy value more promising in PPR leagues. Saturday marked Robinson's first action of the preseason, as he was held out of the New York's exhibition opener against Detroit. ", " Tank Bigsby JaguarsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:31 PM Bigsby rushed 10 times for 37 yards and brought in all three targets for 19 yards in the Jaguars' 20-7 preseason win over the Buccaneers on Saturday night. Spin:Bigsby drew the start with Travis Etienne sitting out, and the second-year back quickly gained a combined 10 yards on the Jaguars' second and third plays from scrimmage. Bigsby's heavy level of involvement by preseason standards and what he did with it was encouraging, especially after a ragged rookie year where he averaged just 2.6 yards per carry. Bigsby appears to be running ahead of D'Ernest Johnson for the No. 2 job behind Etienne, and he'll have another opportunity to make his case in the Friday night road preseason finale against the Falcons. ", " Mac Jones JaguarsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:26 PM Jones completed 16 of 23 passes for 210 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions and added six rushes for 14 yards in the Jaguars' 20-7 preseason win over the Buccaneers. Spin:Jones started and played the entire first half and returned for the fourth quarter after C.J. Beathard (groin) got injured. The 2021 first-round pick of the Patriots, who's looking for a career reset in Jacksonville as Trevor Lawrence's backup, was impressive throughout, and he connected with Parker Washington (25 yards) and Brevin Easton (31 yards) for his pair of touchdown tosses. The two scoring drives spanned 17 and eight plays, confidence-building marches that Jones was able to navigate without turnovers. Jones is likely to see a solid amount of playing time once again in the preseason finale against the Falcons in Atlanta on Friday night. ", " Najee Harris SteelersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:25 PM Harris rushed the ball four times for 17 yards in Saturday's 9-3 preseason loss to the Bills. Spin:The Pittsburgh offense was stymied for nearly the entire game, though Harris did manage a tough nine-yard run late in the first quarter to pick up a first down. The far bigger development Saturday was that Jaylen Warren was forced to exit the game with a hamstring issue. It's unclear how serious the injury is, but it could leave Harris as the clear lead back early in the regular season. ", " Graham Gano GiantsK News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:20 PM Gano converted his only field-goal attempt from 31 yards and made his lone extra-point try in Saturday's preseason loss to Houston. Spin:Gano hasn't had a lot of opportunities through two preseason games -- he didn't try a field goal and made his only extra-point attempt in the Giants' exhibition opener -- but he appears fully recovered from the knee injury that landed him on IR after just eight games last season. The veteran kicker has a big and accurate leg, as evidenced by his 23 field-goal makes on 29 tries from 50-plus yards since joining New York in 2020, but his fantasy value could be capped if the Giants offense isn't vastly better than it was last season. ", " Keon Coleman BillsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:18 PM Coleman recorded one catch on three targets for 12 yards in Saturday's 9-3 preseason win over Pittsburgh. Spin:Coleman played with the first-team offense along with Khalil Shakir and Mack Hollins, while Curtis Samuel didn't suit up. Coleman stayed on the field the longest of the trio, however, and finished second on the team with three targets. He has only two catches on six targets through two exhibition games, though many of those throws have come from Mitch Trubisky rather than Josh Allen. ", " Quentin Johnston ChargersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:14 PM Johnston had one reception on two targets for 18 yards in Saturday's preseason loss to the Rams. Spin:Johnston had a quiet rookie campaign last year in the shadows of former teammate and superstar wideout Keenan Allen. With the latter joining Chicago in the offseason, a large chunk of production suddenly frees up for the current receiver room. Joshua Palmer and early second-round pick Ladd McConkey figure to occupy significant portions of the statistical pie, with Johnston and veteran DJ Chark jockeying for position not far behind the projected duo of young starters. Should Johnston carve out a role as the team's third option or slot receiver, he could wind up outproducing his draft slot this season. ", " Easton Stick ChargersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:13 PM Stick completed eight of his 13 attempts for 85 yards and an interception in Saturday's 13-9 preseason loss to the Rams. He also carried the ball five times for 22 yards, but he did record a fumble. Spin:That's now two bad showings for Stick, who seemed to have the backup quarterback job behind Justin Herbert (foot) locked up at the start of the preseason. It's unclear if the fifth-year veteran is really at risk of losing the positional battle despite the poor outings as projected third-string quarterback, Max Duggan, was a healthy inactive Saturday while training camp addition Luis Perez also struggled to some extent (13 of 20 for 78 yards and a fumble). Stick figures to have one more chance to solidify his standing on the active roster in the team's final preseason game against the Cowboys. ", " Sean Tucker BuccaneersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:11 PM Tucker rushed four times for 32 yards and brought in his only target for one yard in the Buccaneers' 20-7 preseason loss to the Jaguars on Saturday night. He also returned two kickoffs for 55 yards. Spin:Tucker was the second running back to log a carry behind Bucky Irving, and he outgained his teammate by six yards with two fewer carries. Tucker also was effective as a returner, and with 100 rushing yards on 14 carries through two preseason contests, he appears well on his way to securing the No. 3 running back job over Chase Edmonds (undisclosed). ", " Bucky Irving BuccaneersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:07 PM Irving rushed six times for 26 yards in the Buccaneers' 20-7 preseason loss to the Jaguars on Saturday night. Spin:The rookie drew another start with Rachaad White sitting out, and Irving was able to deliver a solid performance with a team-high number of carries. Irving has handled himself well over his first two preseason games and remains on track to serve as the primary complement alongside White, who should enjoy a robust role within new coordinator Liam Coen's offense. ", " Jonnu Smith DolphinsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 9:00 PM Smith brought in all four targets for 23 yards in the Dolphins' 13-6 preseason win over the Commanders on Saturday night. Spin:The veteran offseason addition was on the receiving end of Tua Tagovailoa's second target of the night and finished second in receptions for Miami overall. Smith should have a good chance of developing into the primary pass-catching option at tight end over Durham Smythe as the season unfolds, and Saturday's performance offered a glimpse of what he'll be able to bring as a complementary option to WRs Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle (undisclosed) and Odell Beckham (undisclosed). ", " Kimani Vidal ChargersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:54 PM Vidal had 11 carries for 49 yards with two receptions (three targets) for eight yards in Saturday's preseason tilt against the Rams. Spin:Vidal was deemed a healthy scratch in the Chargers' preseason opener last week, but the tailback was reportedly dealing with a minor injury leading up to the contest, Gavino Borquez of USA Today reports. The sixth-round selection appeared to be operating at full strength Saturday when he led his team in rushing yards in the absence of J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards (coach's decision). Vidal was the second back to touch the football for the Chargers despite finishing as the top producer, as Jaret Patterson earned the first running back touch in the exhibition loss. The latter finished with 38 combined yards on nine touches as the two young backs continue to duke it out on the depth chart this preseason. ", " Eric Gray GiantsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:43 PM Gray rushed three times for 18 yards and added five receptions on six targets for 22 yards in Saturday's preseason loss to Houston. Spin:After shining with 98 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in New York's first exhibition game, Gray took a back seat Saturday while 2024 starting tailback Devin Singletary got his first preseason action. Despite the reduced workload, Gray did nothing to diminish his chance of earning the backup RB role, with his most impressive play being a 13-yard carry in the third quarter. Tyrone Tracy (ankle) missed the game, but his injury isn't expected to be a long-term one, and he could return for the Giants' final preseason contest next Saturday against the Jets. It's still uncertain which of the two will ultimately end up as the primary backup behind Singletary, though both Gray and Tracy could end up getting a fair amount of opportunities in 2024 if Singletary isn't used as a workhorse to the same extent that Saquon Barkley was last year. ", " Trey Benson CardinalsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:38 PM Benson carried the ball nine times for 43 yards and was not targeted in Saturday's preseason loss to the Colts. Spin:The third-round pick started at running back for the second week in a row as veteran starter James Conner continues to sit along with quarterback Kyler Murray during exhibition play. Benson fared much better in his second go around as temporary lead back after gaining just 21 yards on eight carries last week. It's worth noting that the rookie remained ahead of Emari Demercado (shoulder) on Saturday after the latter returned from a minor injury. Perhaps Benson has a shot to elevate himself into the No. 2 role over the incumbent option based on how the players were deployed while both active. ", " Mason Kinsey TitansWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:29 PM Kinsey suffered a broken pinky finger in Saturday's preseason victory versus Seattle, Turron Davenport of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Despite the injury, Kinsey returned to the contest and plans to practice next week. The fourth-year wideout is on the roster bubble, so avoiding missed time could be critical to his chances of landing a depth role among the Titans' receiver corps. Kinsey finished Saturday's win with two catches (on five targets) for 29 yards. ", " Ladd McConkey ChargersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:16 PM McConkey caught his only target for five yards in Saturday's preseason loss to the Rams. Spin:McConkey made his debut for the Chargers against the team's cross-town rivals after sitting out last week's exhibition. The 34th selection in this year's draft didn't get a ton of burn with the rest of the starters Saturday, but he registered the first preseason catch of his career from the arm of backup quarterback Easton Stick. McConkey's fantasy upside in 2024 is tied to the rookie's ability to earn, maintain and flourish as one of starting quarterback Justin Herbert's top targets. ", " De'Von Achane DolphinsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:12 PM Achane rushed twice for 10 yards and secured two of three targets for 34 yards in the Dolphins' 13-6 preseason win over the Commanders on Saturday night. Spin:The second-year back took his first carry with 7:29 remaining in the first quarter and played a total of three possessions. Achane recorded chunk gains of seven yards on the ground and eight and 26 yards through the air, flashing the signature explosiveness that made him a rookie sensation in 2023. Achane already appears in regular-season form, but it remains to be seen if he'll have a chance to garner a few more touches in Friday night's road preseason finale against the Buccaneers. ", " Kenny McIntosh SeahawksRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:09 PM McIntosh rushed the ball eight times for 46 yards in Saturday's 16-15 preseason loss to the Titans. He added two receptions (on two targets) for 17 yards. Spin:McIntosh is reportedly being pushed for the third spot on the depth chart by George Holani, though he got the better end of that competition Saturday. With Kenneth Walker resting and Zach Charbonnet (undisclosed) unavailable, McIntosh got the first touch out of the backfield and also led the team in both attempts and rushing yards. In addition to the volume, McIntosh showed some impressive physicality and had a long gain of 12 yards on the ground while also tacking on a 10-yard reception. ", " Raheem Mostert DolphinsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:06 PM Mostert rushed five times for seven yards in the Dolphins' 13-6 preseason win over the Commanders on Saturday night. Spin:After the Dolphins opened with back-to-back passing plays on their first drive, Mostert took three straight carries and netted six yards. The veteran back would continue alternating with De'Von Achane for the remainder of the opening possession but only gained one additional yard on his final two totes, and Saturday's cameo appearance could well be the extent of Mostert's preseason action given his age and the fact there's only one exhibition remaining. ", " Marvin Harrison Jr. CardinalsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:03 PM Harrison (coach's decision) did not play in Saturday's 21-13 preseason loss to the Colts. Spin:Harrison was held out of the Cardinals' second preseason tilt after receiving no targets in one series with the starters in last week's exhibition. Fans and fantasy managers alike may have to wait until the start of the regular season if Arizona's coaching staff continues to handle its new talent with kid gloves in games of no consequence. Harrison will be healthy and ready to roll come Week 1, providing massive fantasy upside as Kyler Murray's likely top target. ", " Jamari Thrash BrownsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:59 PM Thrash caught three of five targets for 25 yards in Saturday's 27-12 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:The Browns sat all their starters and key reserves, and none of Amari Cooper (undisclosed), Jerry Jeudy, Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman were on the field. That created opportunities for the team's depth wideouts, and Thrash, a 2024 fifth-round pick out of Louisville, finished the day tied for the team lead in targets with running back D'Onta Foreman. With David Bell (quadriceps) currently sidelined, there could be an opening for Thrash to win the No. 5 spot on the wide receiver depth chart to begin the season. ", " D'Onta Foreman BrownsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:54 PM Foreman carried the ball 10 times for 18 yards and a touchdown and caught all five of his targets for 46 yards in Saturday's 27-12 preseason loss to the Vikings. He also returned one kickoff for 21 yards. Spin:Foreman was not part of the starting lineup, but he did enter on the opening series once the Browns reached the red zone and punched in a one-yard TD to cap the drive. With Jerome Ford sitting out and Nick Chubb (knee) not ready for game action yet, Pierre Strong got the start Saturday in the Cleveland backfield and played only two series before checking out. Foreman then played into the third quarter, and he wound up leading the Browns in touches and yards from scrimmage. The journeyman made a solid case to begin the season as the No. 3 RB behind Ford and Strong, but Saturday's usage could also have been a sign the Browns are showcasing Foreman for a potential trade. ", " Dorian Thompson-Robinson BrownsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:44 PM Thompson-Robinson completed 13 of 17 passes for 126 yards and an interception in Saturday's 27-12 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:The Browns sat their starters and key reserves for this one, and Thompson-Robinson got the start over Tyler Huntley as the duo compete for the No. 3 spot on the quarterback depth chart. Thompson-Robinson was efficient and led a touchdown drive on Cleveland's opening possession, but he also ended his day with an interception in the red zone during a two-minute drill just before halftime. Huntley got picked off twice in the second half, however, providing little clarity on the job battle. ", " Trishton Jackson VikingsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:31 PM Jackson caught three of four targets for 39 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 27-12 preseason win over the Browns. He also gained six rushing yards on one carry. Spin:The Vikings sat starting wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison (ankle) on Saturday, but Jackson surprisingly got the start in 11 personnel alongside Jalen Nailor and Brandon Powell over veteran Trent Sherfield. Jackson capitalized on the opportunity, hauling in a back-shoulder throw from Nick Mullens and getting his toes down in bounds for a 14-yard touchdown on the team's first possession. The undrafted player out of Syracuse suited up for seven games last season -- his first NFL action -- as he bounced between the practice squad and the game-day roster, but he would find himself with a more consistent role in 2024 if he wins the No. 5 receiver job. ", " Sione Vaki LionsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:23 PM Vaki ran for 22 yards on six carries and caught four passes for 60 yards on four targets in Saturday's preseason game against Kansas City. Spin:The rookie fourth-round pick out of Utah seemingly played in the rotation following Craig Reynolds, who took the first touch at running back with Jahmyr Gibbs (hamstring) and David Montgomery left out of the game. The Lions plan to run often and are expected to keep all four running backs on the roster, and whatever the depth chart placement might be between Vaki and Reynolds at the moment could change over the course of the year. Vaki's pass-catching upside stands out, not just because of his strong showing Saturday but even more so because Vaki turned 14 targets into 11 catches for 203 yards and three touchdowns for Utah last year. ", " Nick Mullens VikingsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:14 PM Mullens completed 11 of 21 passes for 135 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 27-12 preseason win over the Browns. Spin:None of the Vikings' starters were on the field Saturday, and even some key reserves like Ty Chandler sat out, but Mullens still put together a decent line while playing with backups for the entire first half. With rookie J.J. McCarthy (knee) out for the season, Mullens will provide Minnesota with an experienced backup to Sam Darnold at quarterback -- and Darnold's track record at least offers the possibility that he will play his way out of another starting job, opening the door for Mullens to take over the offense. ", " Brevin Jordan TexansTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 6:06 PM Jordan caught both of his targets for 16 yards in Saturday's 28-10 preseason win over the Giants. Spin:The tight end missed the Texans' preseason opener due to an undisclosed injury, but he was on the field with the first-team offense Saturday as Houston lined up in 12 personnel for both of C.J. Stroud's drives. Jordan is the team's No. 2 tight end behind Dalton Schultz, but that could still get him on the field more than expected if offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik uses that as his base package. Jordan has never caught more than 20 passes or gained more than 219 receiving yards in a season, and his fantasy value has a firm ceiling on it as long as Schultz is healthy, but the 2021 fifth-round pick might at least get an opportunity to top those numbers in 2024. ", " Darius Slayton GiantsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 5:44 PM Slayton caught all three of his targets for a team-high 59 yards in Saturday's 28-10 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:The speedster quickly reforged his connection with Daniel Jones in the quarterback's first game action since he tore his ACL in Week 9 of last season, hauling in a 44-yard strike in the second quarter that nearly went for a touchdown, although Slayton was ruled down at the one-yard line. The 27-year-old has led the Giants in receiving yards in four of the last five seasons despite never having an 800-yard campaign, and while that honor is expected to pass to rookie Malik Nabers in 2024, Slayton should still have a big role in the team's passing game. ", " Irvin Charles JetsWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 5:34 PM Charles is questionable to return to Saturday's exhibition contest against Carolina due to a hip injury. Spin:Charles didn't draw a target before getting hurt, and it's unclear if he'll be able to reenter the game. The 6-foot-4 wideout has had a strong camp and has a solid chance of making the 53-man roster if the toe issue doesn't prove to be serious. As with last year, Charles may see most of his work on special teams if he does make the cut, though it's certainly possible that he could get more opportunities on offense this season. ", " Corey Davis JetsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 4:17 PM Davis has decided he doesn't want to return to the NFL, Sal Capaccio of WGR Sports Radio 550 Buffalo reports. Spin:After announcing his retirement last August, Davis applied for reinstatement this March and was subsequently released by the Jets so that he could pursue an opportunity elsewhere. The wideout had a tryout with the Bills this week, but it appears that nothing will come of it given Cappacio's report. Davis is only 29 years old, but it was never a given that he'd land a significant role with an NFL club if he did decide to return given that he hasn't suited up since 2022. ", " Rashee Rice ChiefsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 3:53 PM Rice caught four receptions for 35 yards on five targets in Saturday's preseason game against Detroit. Spin:Just as he did in his highly successful 2023 rookie season, Rice primarily operated from the slot and on short routes Saturday. Rice's rare short-area burst allows him to be productive on such looks, and he was close to automatic for the Chiefs on Saturday. It would help Rice's fantasy upside if he could draw some targets downfield as well, but his proficiency at racking up yards after the catch could keep him in a slot role frequently. ", " Xavier Legette PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 3:30 PM Legette is not expected to play in Saturday's preseason game against the Jets, Darin Gantt of the team's official site reports. Spin:The Panthers are opting to keep the majority of their starters out of the preseason contest, including the first-round rookie. Expect Jonathan Mingo and Terrace Marshall to get a bit of playing time until roster bubble wideouts such as Ihmir Smith-Marsette, David Moore and Mike Strachan get their fair share of opportunities. ", " Adam Thielen PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 3:03 PM Thielen isn't expected to play in Saturday's preseason contest versus the Jets, Darin Gantt of the Panthers' official site reports. Spin:Thielen will be joined by fellow wideouts Diontae Johnson (groin) and Xavier Legette in street clothes this weekend, meaning Terrace Marshall, Jonathan Mingo and Ihmir Smith-Marsette, among others, will man the position. At this point in his career, Thielen, a 10-year pro, doesn't necessarily require any reps before Week 1, when he'll begin his quest to replicate his 103-1,014-4 line on 137 targets in 17 regular-season contests in 2023. ", " Gerald Everett BearsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 2:29 PM Everett caught two of four targets for 10 yards in Saturday's preseason win over the Bengals. Spin:Everett got a lot of playing time on the first-team offense for a second straight week, including as the lone tight end in three-wide formations. Everett's usage has led to concern about Cole Kmet failing to match his near-every-down role from the past three season, but even if that happens, it's unlikely Everett would get enough snaps/routes to achieve mainstream fantasy utility of his own. ", " Cole Kmet BearsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 2:28 PM Kmet caught his lone target for nine yards in Saturday's 27-3 preseason win over Cincinnati. Spin:Kmet and Gerald Everett rotated on the first-team offense for a second straight week, with the latter catching two of four targets for 10 yards in Saturday's win. Everett's involvement -- after signing a two-year, $12 million contract -- creates reasonable concerns about Kmet not matching his robust snap shares from the past three seasons, but Kmet could still take the lion's share of playing time once the games actually matter. ", " Dante Pettis BearsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 2:23 PM Pettis caught each of his three targets for 53 yards and two touchdowns in a 27-3 preseason win over the Bengals on Saturday. Spin:A 2018 second-round pick, Pettis was the Bears' No. 3 receiver as recently as 2022 but didn't play in 2023 after suffering a back injury last August. He's now battling for one of the final roster spots, having caught each of his three passes Saturday in the third quarter after starting QB Caleb Williams was pulled from the game. ", " Gunner Olszewski GiantsWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 2:09 PM Olszewski went down with a groin injury in Thursday's practice and will be out for a while, Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News reports. Spin:The 6-foot return specialist's groin injury ended up sidelining him for Saturday's 28-10 preseason loss against Houston. Olszewski was primed to potentially serve as the primary returner for the Giants, but Isaiah McKenzie took the reps during the preseason game and will likely continue to do so. ", " Chris Blair FalconsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 12:53 PM Blair caught four of five targets for 91 yards in Saturday's 13-12 preseason loss to Baltimore. Spin:Blair had more than three-fourths of Atlanta's receiving yards in the first half and then added a 27-yard catch in the third quarter before calling it a day. He's a 2021 UDFA with one regular-season NFL appearance to his name, but he flashed some downfield chops this past spring with the UFL's DC Defenders while generating a 25-584-3 across 10 regular-season games. Blair's total of 136 yards through two preseason games gives him a decent case for a backup job on a team with shaky WR depth behind starters Drake London and Darnell Mooney. ", " Khalil Herbert BearsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 12:34 PM Herbert started Saturday's preseason win over the Bengals and took five carries for 31 yards in the first half. Spin:D'Andre Swift was held out entirely after playing just two snaps in the preseason opener. It's a signal that the Bears consider Swift important and want to protect him, but Herbert at least has taken advantage of his extended playing time with the first-string offense this preseason, taking 17 carries for 97 yards in three appearances (including the Hall of Fame Game). He hasn't seen any targets, in part because Travis Homer has replaced him for some of the clear passing downs (Roschon Johnson didn't play the past two weeks, perhaps because of a minor injury). The way things have played out so far makes it a bit tricky to get a read on Chicago's backfield, apart from Swift being the lead guy. There have been rumors about the Bears showcasing Herbert for a potential trade, but it might just be that they like him to mix in behind Swift on early downs. ", " Jerome Ford BrownsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 12:22 PM Ford isn't expected to play in Saturday's preseason game against Minnesota, Scott Petrak of the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram reports. Spin:Ford started Cleveland's preseason opener and took two carries for four yards, but for this one he's on the long list of players expected to sit out, joined by QB Deshaun Watson, TE David Njoku and a handful of wide receivers. With fellow running backs Nick Chubb (knee) and Nyheim Hines (knee) still unavailable, Cleveland is left with Pierre Strong, D'Onta Foreman and Aidan Robbins as the backfield options. ", " Keenan Allen BearsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:18 AM Allen was held without a catch on one target in Saturday's preseason game against the Bengals. Spin:Allen and DJ Moore were removed after three drives, all three-and-outs, while many of the Bears' other top players (including QB Caleb Williams and WR Rome Odunze) continued playing deep into the second quarter. Oddly, much of the discussion about Allen in recent weeks has centered on his weight, after SI's Albert Breer's offhand mention in an article that Allen is 230 pounds. That doesn't seem accurate, and the 32-year-old looks about the same as he did last season when the Chargers listed him at 211 pounds (the Bears' roster has him at 211 as well). ", " Andrew Beck TexansRB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 11:15 AM Beck (calf) is out for Saturday's preseason game versus the Giants, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Beck sat out Houston's first two preseason games as well. Until he returns, Troy Hairston should take the lion's share of Houston's fullback reps. ", " Justin Jefferson VikingsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 10:22 AM Jefferson and most other starters aren't expected to play in Saturday's preseason game against the Browns, Mark Craig of The Star Tribune reports. Spin:It sounds like the Vikings will use fewer key players than they did in their preseason opener, although Jefferson was also held out for that one. He's set to open the season with Sam Darnold as his starting QB after J.J. McCarthy's season-ending meniscus surgery put an end to any thoughts of a job battle. ", " Deven Thompkins FAWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:49 AM Thompkins (hamstring) was waived from the Panthers' injured reserve list after reaching an injury settlement with the team Saturday, Greg Auman of Fox Sports reports. Spin:The third-year wideout reverted to the Panthers' IR on Monday after being waived/injured Sunday, and the team has now officially decided to part ways with Thompkins. With the injury settlement agreed upon, Thompkins is free to sign elsewhere once he recovers from his hamstring issue. ", " Albert Okwuegbunam Jr. EaglesTE Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 8:22 AM Okwuegbunam (abdomen) did not participate at practice Saturday, Andrew DiCecco of InsideTheBirds.com reports. Spin:It was previously reported that Okwuegbunam's abdomen injury is not serious, but it's at least somewhat concerning that it's still keeping him off the field as the regular season approaches. Whether he gets a spot on the final 53-man roster may depend on how many tight ends Philadelphia's opts to keep on it. ", " Grant Calcaterra EaglesTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 7:29 AM Calcaterra (shoulder) participated at practice Saturday, Olivia Reiner of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Spin:Apparently, the shoulder issue Calcaterra is dealing with is only a minor one. Barring any more setbacks, he projects for a peripheral role in Philadelphia's offense behind Dallas Goedert in 2024. ", " Jake Browning BengalsQB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 17, 7:03 AM Browning (ribs) won't play in Saturday's preseason game against Chicago, Paul Dehner Jr. of The Athletic reports. Spin:Browning played in the preseason opener but threw for only 52 yards on 18 pass attempts, and he then missed practice this week with a rib injury sustained during the game. Coach Zac Taylor said he expects the QB to \"miss some time\" but didn't go into further detail. August 16 Ameer Abdullah RaidersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 3:09 PM Abdullah is competing with rookie sixth-round pick Dylan Laube for a third-down role behind starting running back Zamir White, Tashan Reed of The Athletic reports. Spin:Abdullah has handled a key special-teams role across two seasons with the Raiders, which he figures to reprise in 2024, but he could also contribute more on offense if he's able to secure regular pass-catching snaps. White and backup Alexander Mattison figure to dominate carries for Las Vegas, but one of Abdullah or Laube could emerge as a somewhat reliable target this season. Last year, Abdullah secured 19 of 24 targets for 131 yards in 17 regular-season games. ", " Michael Carter CardinalsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 2:42 PM Carter is competing for standing on Arizona's roster behind starter James Conner, after having ended the 2023 season in the No. 2 role, Jeremy Cluff of the Arizona Republic reports. Spin:Carter totaled 30 carries for 187 yards across 15 regular-season games between the Jets and Cardinals last season, in addition to 24 catches for 101 yards and one touchdown on 31 targets. Now, though, the addition of rookie third-round pick Trey Benson has crowded Arizona's backfield, and Carter is competing for standing alongside Emari Demercado (shoulder) and DeeJay Dallas, in addition to Tony Jones. It would help Carter's case to impress in the preseason, with Saturday's exhibition game against the Colts representing his next chance to do so. ", " Kalif Raymond LionsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 1:27 PM Raymond appears to have solidified himself as the No. 3 wide receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, Colton Pouncy of The Athletic reports. Spin:Raymond is positioned to replace the departed Josh Reynolds as the No. 3 wide receiver, though given the importance of TE Sam LaPorta (hamstring) and RB Jahmyr Gibbs (hamstring) in the passing game, that isn't a role that will necessarily translate to regular targets. Pouncy notes that Donovan Peoples-Jones and Daurice Fountain have also made some noise at training camp, but barring any additions to the wide receiver room, Raymond looks set to start in three-wide sets. He will have a chance to further entrench himself during Saturday's preseason game against the Chiefs. ", " Matt Corral VikingsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 1:22 PM The Vikings signed Corral to a contract Friday. Spin:Corral signing with Minnesota corresponds to the team's official placement of rookie No. 10 overall pick J.J. McCarthy (knee) on season-ending injured reserve. A 2022 third-round pick, Corral began his NFL career with the Panthers but missed his entire rookie season due to a foot injury. He then spent some time developing with the Patriots and saw some action this spring with the UFL's Birmingham Stallions, but he's still waiting on an opportunity to make his official NFL debut. He now gets a chance to compete with Jaren Hall for a role in the quarterback room behind Week 1 starter Sam Darnold and journeyman backup Nick Mullens. ", " J.J. McCarthy VikingsQB Injured Reserve News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 1:18 PM The Vikings placed McCarthy (knee) on injured reserve Friday. Spin:Minnesota signed quarterback Matt Corral in a corresponding transaction. Head coach Kevin O'Connell had already ruled McCarthy, the No. 10 overall pick in April's draft, out for the season, so his official placement on injured reserve was expected. McCarthy will turn his attention to making a recovery from the surgery he underwent Wednesday to make a full repair of the meniscus in his right knee, while the Vikings turn to Sam Darnold as the Week 1 starter. Corral joins Nick Mullens and second-year quarterback Jaren Hall behind Darnold on the depth chart. ", " Jakob Johnson GiantsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 11:17 AM Johnson was signed by the Giants on Friday, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports. Spin:The fullback/tight end will play for a new team in the 2024 season after spending the last two years with Las Vegas, bringing in six catches for 22 yards in that span. With the tight-end pecking order still undetermined for New York, Johnson could compete for a part in the team's passing game, or he could become a staple fullback blocker for running back Devin Singletary. ", " Evan McPherson BengalsK News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 10:43 AM McPherson agreed to terms Friday on a three-year, $16.5 million extension with the Bengals, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports. Spin:McPherson's new deal reportedly includes $10 million in its first year. The 2021 fifth-round pick converted 26 of 31 field goals across 17 regular-season games last year and was a perfect 40-for-40 on PATs. All five of McPherson's missed field-goal tries in 2023 came from 50-plus yards out. It's no surprise to see Cincinnati ink one of the league's best kickers to a long-term deal, and with Joe Burrow back under center to lead the Bengals' offense, McPherson's fantasy prospects look improved for 2024. ", " K.J. Osborn PatriotsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 9:29 AM Osborn logged 13 snaps on offense in Thursday's 14-13 preseason loss to the Eagles. Spin:Osborn didn't see any targets versus Philadelphia, but he was in the starting lineup for a second straight preseason contest. With JuJu Smith-Schuster released and Kendrick Bourne (knee) a candidate to miss the start of the season, Osborn is on track for the Week 1 start in a WR corps that also includes promising second-year player DeMario Douglas, rookies Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker and returnees Tyquan Thornton, Kayshon Boutte and Jalen Reagor. Osborn could merit attention in deeper fantasy formats, but he's never been a big-time target earner and may now be stuck in a cautious, run-first offense. ", " Javon Baker PatriotsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 9:15 AM Baker caught one of his four targets for 12 yards in Thursday's 14-13 preseason loss to the Eagles. Spin:Baker, who recorded 24 snaps in the contest, only hauled in one of his targets, but the 2024 fourth-rounder did manage to get his hands on a couple of other throws, including a diving attempt on a deep ball from QB Drake Maye in the second quarter. Per Chad Graff of The Athletic, Baker has demonstrated boom-or-bust tendencies this summer, but the UCF product does have a chance to grow into a role in the Patriots' pass-catching corps as a rookie, provided he can gain more consistency to pair with his play-making potential. ", " Kendrick Bourne PatriotsWR Out News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 8:41 AM Bourne (knee) remains on the active/PUP list ahead of the Patriots' Aug. 25 preseason finale, Jacob Rousseau and Bill Kochof the Providence Journal report. Spin:It remains to be seen when Bourne -- who is bouncing back from a torn right ACL that he suffered last October -- will be able to resume practicing, but as Week 1 approaches, it becomes increasingly plausible that the veteran wideout could start the coming campaign on the PUP list. With the Patriots guided by a new coaching staff and transitioning at the quarterback and wide receiver positions, we suspect that the team will err on the side of caution with Bourne out of the gate this season. If he does end up out or limited early on, added opportunities would be available for some combination of DeMario Douglas, Ja'Lynn Polk, K.J. Osborn, Javon Baker, Tyquan Thornton, Kayshon Boutteand Jalen Reagor. ", " Kyren Williams RamsRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 16, 7:02 AM The Rams don't plan to play Williams or other key players in Saturday's preseason game against the Chargers, Cameron DaSilva of USA Today reports. Spin:Coach Sean McVay suggested his plan will be similar to the preseason opener against Dallas, in which the Rams not only held out starters but also a lot of key backups, including rookie RB Blake Corum. McVay even said the list of rested players could be longer this time, so there's no reason to expect an appearance from starters like Williams and Cooper Kupp who are ticketed for huge roles come Week 1. There is some thought that Corum's presence will leave Williams with lighter workloads than he handled last year, but the third-year pro can afford to lose some work and still maintain considerable fantasy value, after averaging 19.0 carries and 4.0 targets in 12 appearances last year. Williams missed 12 regular-season games over his first two campaigns, and there is some concern that missed time in 2024 would allow Corum to thrive in a lead role and complicate the Rams' backfield thereafter. August 15 DeMario Douglas PatriotsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 7:21 PM Douglas caught one of two targets for one yard in Thursday's 14-13 preseason loss to the Eagles. Spin:It was nice to see Douglas suit up Thursday after he missed the preseason opener against the Panthers due to a hand injury. The second-year slot receiver accounted for one of Jacoby Brissett's three completions in the first quarter. Regardless of whether Brissett or rookie third overall pick Drake Maye starts under center in the regular season, Douglas figures to be one of the Patriots' top pass catchers after posting 561 receiving yards as a rookie in 2023. New England's preseason finale will be Aug. 25 against the Commanders. ", " Kenny Pickett EaglesQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 7:08 PM Pickett completed 11 of 13 passes for 67 yards while adding two rushing attempts for six yards in Thursday's 14-13 preseason win over the Patriots. Spin:Pickett played the entire first half as Jalen Hurts once again got the night off. The former Pittsburgh quarterback was content checking the ball down and led the offense to only three points, though he didn't have top skill players such as A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith or Saquon Barkley at his disposal. Despite having 24 regular-season starts under his belt, Pickett figures to get extensive playing time in the Eagles' Aug. 24 preseason finale against the Vikings as he continues to familiarize himself with his new team's offense. ", " A.J. Brown EaglesWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 7:06 PM Brown didn't play in Thursday's 14-13 preseason win over the Patriots. Spin:Brown was joined by QB Jalen Hurts, fellow WR DeVonta Smith and RB Saquon Barkley on the sidelines as Philadelphia's top skill-position players got the night off, as was also the case in the preseason opener. Regardless of whether Brown suits up in the preseason finale against the Vikings on Saturday, Aug. 24, he's poised to maintain a key role come the regular season after racking up 2,952 receiving yards and 18 receiving touchdowns across his previous two regular seasons with the Eagles. ", " Joe Flacco ColtsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 6:09 PM Flacco isn't expected to play in Saturday's preseason game against the Cardinals, Joel A. Erickson of The Indianapolis Star reports. Spin:Flacco is expected to sit, as are the bulk of the Colts' starters. The 39-year-old did play last week against Denver, completing 3-of-5 passes for 28 yards on his lone series of work. Flacco has the Colts' QB2 job sewn up behind Anthony Richardson. Look for plenty of Sam Ehlinger this weekend for Indianapolis. ", " Chris Evans BengalsRB Injured Reserve News Archive \t MON, AUG 19, 2:55 PM Evans (leg) was placed on injured reserve Monday. Spin:The move was a formality for Evans after it was already reported he would miss the 2024 campaign due to suffering a torn patellar tendon during a joint practice with the Bears on Thursday. The Michigan product was competing for a spot on Cincinnati's running back depth chart behind Zack Moss and Chase Brown before suffering the injury. ", " Charlie Jones BengalsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 5:07 PM Jones (knee) returned to practice Thursday. Spin:The wide receiver last practiced a week ago but was carted off after banging knees with a defender. Jones is competing for a role as a depth receiver and return man. The 2023 fourth-round pick caught seven passes for 64 yards and no scores as a rookie. ", " Johnny Wilson EaglesWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 4:21 PM Wilson is in the concussion protocol and wasn't available for Thursday's preseason game at New England, Olivia Reiner of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Spin:Wilson entered the protocol following Tuesday's joint practice with the Patriots. Now that he's dealing with a head injury, his status will be up in the air ahead of the Eagles' exhibition finale Saturday, Aug. 24 against the Vikings. In one preseason contest to date, Wilson, a rookie sixth-round pick, recorded a seven-yard catch on three targets last Friday at Baltimore. ", " Noah Brown TexansWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 4:12 PM Brown (shoulder) missed practice Thursday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The wide receiver has been out since early August with the injury, including missing Houston's preseason game against the Steelers on Aug. 9. Brown recorded a career-high 567 receiving yards in 2023 and is competing for the fourth wide receiver spot behind Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell and Nico Collins. ", " Joshua Kelley GiantsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 4:12 PM The Giants signed Kelley on Thursday, Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News reports. Spin:Kelley spent much of the offseason as a free agent after his contract with the Chargers expired back in March. He wasn't retained by Los Angeles' new coaching staff after Kelley amassed a 320-1,148-6 rushing line across four seasons with the Bolts. It's less than ideal to join a team this deep into camp, but Kelley will try to impress the Giants over the next couple weeks ahead of the regular season. ", " Teagan Quitoriano TexansTE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 4:07 PM Quitoriano (calf) did not participate in practice Thursday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The tight end strained his calf during an Aug. 3 preseason game against the Bears. Quitoriano was the Texans' third tight end before going down, but Cade Stover has taken his place in the days since the injury. ", " Trace McSorley CommandersQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 3:14 PM Coach Dan Quinn said McSorley, who the Commanders signed on Thursday, will suit up for Saturday's game against the Dolphins, Nicki Jhabvala of The Washington Post reports. Spin:Quinn said that with Marcus Mariota (groin) and Sam Hartman (shoulder) both out for Saturday's exhibition contest, McSorley will get an immediate chance to suit up for his new team. Rookie first-round pick Jayden Daniels and No. 3 quarterback Jeff Driskel remain ahead of McSorley on the depth chart, even with Mariota and Hartman sidelined. ", " Jalen Hurts EaglesQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 2:30 PM Hurts isn't expected to play in Thursday's preseason game against the Patriots, according to ESPN's Mike Reiss. Spin:Reiss' pre-game report on ESPN aligns with that of Jeff McLane of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who noted that the Eagles aren't expected to play their starters on offense versus New England. In that scenario, Hurts' final opportunity to see exhibition action will occur Saturday, Aug. 24 against the Vikings. ", " Chase Claypool FAWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 1:59 PM The Bills have reached an injury settlement with Claypool (toe), Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The Bills placed Claypool on injured reserve Tuesday, but following Thursday's injury settlement, the veteran wideout is now free to catch on elsewhere once he's past a toe issue that he sustained July 28. Unless he ends up in an ideal situation, however, the 2020 second-rounder seems unlikely to make much of a fantasy impact early on this season. ", " Zach Ertz CommandersTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 8:48 AM Ertz won't play in Saturday's preseason game against Miami, Nicki Jhabvala of The Washington Post reports. Spin:Ertz is away from the team for the birth of his child, so he'll likely miss a practice or two in addition to the preseason game. He ended up playing a few snaps in the preseason opener against New York, after pregame reports suggested he'd be held out. Ertz is expected to open the season as Washington's top pass catcher at tight end, but if he fails to produce early on he'll be looking over his shoulder at rookie second-round pick Ben Sinnott. ", " DK Metcalf SeahawksWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 15, 7:20 AM Metcalf isn't likely to play in any games this preseason, Gregg Bell of The News Tribune reports. Spin:Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said joint practices with the Titans this week will be the best opportunity for Metcalf and other top players to solidify their knowledge of the new offense brought in by coordinator Ryan Grubb. The Seahawks opted for personnel continuity on offense this offseason, apart from some discount signings for the O-line, so they're counting on Grubb to improve a unit that finished middle of the pack in most efficiency stats last year. A faster-paced offense could help Metcalf and other key players score more fantasy points, after the Seahawks finished 32nd, 22nd and 32nd in overall play volume the past three seasons under former head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron. There's certainly no lack of skill-position talent, with Metcalf joined by WRs Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, RBs Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet and TE Noah Fant. August 14 Keelan Doss FAWR Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 3:11 PM The Raiders released Doss (undisclosed) from IR with an injury settlement Wednesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Doss will be free to sign elsewhere in the league, once healthy. The 28-year-old wideout suited up for five games with the Chargers last season, during which he secured six of 13 targets for 33 yards. ", " Tucker Fisk ChargersTE News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 2:52 PM The Chargers signed Fisk (undisclosed) to a contract Wednesday. Spin:Fisk is healthy after having been waived from IR by the Falcons earlier this offseason. He appeared in six games with Atlanta last season and turned his only target into a nine-yard reception. Now, Fisk will get a chance to compete for a depth spot in Los Angeles' tight end room. ", " Jonathan Ward SteelersRB Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 2:44 PM Coach Mike Tomlin said Wednesday that Ward (hamstring) was injured at practice, Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Spin:Ward managed to walk off the field under his own power, but his status now looks uncertain for Saturday's preseason game against the Bills. He's competing for a depth role in Pittsburgh's deep running back room. ", " Bub Means SaintsWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 2:32 PM Means (undisclosed) was a full participant in Wednesday's practice, Ross Jackson of WWL Louisiana reports. Spin:Means and Rashid Shaheed (hamstring) both shed their non-contact jerseys and practiced in full Wednesday. A rookie fifth-round pick, Means is competing for a depth role on New Orleans' final roster, so he'll work to make a splash during Sunday's preseason game against the 49ers. ", " Lucas Krull BroncosTE News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 1:58 PM Krull (toe) returned to practice Wednesday, Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com reports. Spin:Krull exited the Broncos' Sunday exhibition game against the Colts early with the injury. His quick return will help keep him firmly in the competition for the team's No. 3 tight end spot behind Adam Trautman and Greg Dulcich. ", " Justin Watson ChiefsWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 10:54 AM Watson could see more opportunities early on during the season while fellow wideout Marquise Brown tends to a shoulder injury, Adam Teicher of ESPN.com reports. Spin:With Brown unable to practice and his availability for Week 1 unclear, Watson has been taking many of the snaps in training camp that would have otherwise gone to Brown. Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy would likely rank as greater priorities for targets if Brown's absence bleeds into the regular season, but Watson could be the top choice to join the two in three-receiver sets sans Brown. During the 2023 season, Watson suited up in 16 contests on his way to finishing with a 27-460-3 receiving line on 53 targets over 513 offensive snaps. ", " Andy Dalton PanthersQB News Archive \t WED, AUG 14, 10:12 AM Dalton (quadriceps) returned to practice Wednesday, David Newton of ESPN.com Reports. Spin:Dalton injured his quad Aug. 1 and was expected to need a couple of weeks to recover. The veteran quarterback should have a firm grasp on the Panthers' backup job to starter Bryce Young. August 13 Tanner Brown FAK News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 6:12 PM The Rams waived Brown on Tuesday. Spin:Brown didn't attempt a field goal in Sunday's preseason game against the Cowboys, while Joshua Karty made both of his field-goal attempts and converted his lone extra-point attempt. Should he clear waivers, Brown will look to catch onto a team in need of a kicker. He converted 22 of 23 field-goal attempts and converted all 42 of his extra-point attempts in his final collegiate season with Stanford in 2022. ", " Antoine Green LionsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 5:05 PM Green (concussion) reverted to Detroit's reserve/injured list Tuesday after clearing waivers, per the NFL transaction log. Spin:Green hauled in all three of his targets for 13 yards in Thursday's preseason game against the Giants before leaving due to a concussion he sustained on a block attempt in the second quarter. The 2023 seventh-round pick was getting reps with the Lions' first-team offense alongside wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams early in training camp. However, now that he's on IR, Green will be forced to miss the entire 2024 season unless he reaches an injury settlement with Detroit. ", " Curtis Hodges FATE Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 4:37 PM The Panthers waived Hodges (undisclosed) from injured reserve with an injury settlement Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:After being let go by Washington in January, Hodges signed with Carolina on Aug. 1 to compete for a depth spot at tight end, but he was waived/injured two days later with an unspecified injury. With the injury settlement, Hodges is free to try out with another team once he is fully recovered from whatever is ailing him. ", " Ben Mason FARB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 4:31 PM The Chargers waived Mason (undisclosed) on Tuesday with an injury waiver, per the NFL's official transaction log. Spin:The Steelers have not provided much transparency regarding the specific nature of Mason's injury. Assuming he ultimately clears waivers, the fullback will join the free-agent ranks. ", " John Kelly Jr. RavensRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 3:39 PM The Ravens signed Kelly to a contract Tuesday. Spin:Kelly spent most of last season on Cleveland's practice squad but didn't suit up for a regular-season game with the team. The 2018 sixth-round pick now has a chance to compete for a deep depth role in Baltimore, with his best-case scenario likely to be a spot on the practice squad again. ", " Jeff Smith FAWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 3:25 PM The Cardinals released Smith (undisclosed) with an injury settlement Tuesday, per the NFL's official transaction log. Spin:Smith spent the entire offseason with Arizona, but he appears to have picked up an undisclosed injury during training camp. The journeyman wideout will be eligible to sign with another club once healthy. He suited up for 11 regular-season games with the Jets last year, hauling in eight of 11 targets for 134 yards in that span. ", " Daylen Baldwin CardinalsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 3:13 PM The Cardinals signed Baldwin to a contract Tuesday. Spin:Baldwin spent time with Atlanta earlier this offseason but was cut by the team early August. Now, the third-year pro gets a chance to compete in Arizona's wide receiver room. Baldwin appeared in one game with the Browns as a rookie in 2022, but he hasn't suited up for regular-season action since then. ", " Lawrence Cager GiantsTE Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 2:33 PM Cager (groin) did not practice Tuesday due to a groin injury, Art Stapleton of The Bergen Record reports. Spin:Cager was sidelined due to a hamstring injury to begin training camp, and upon returning to practice Sunday he quickly suffered a groin issue. The 26-year-old is competing for a depth role at tight end, but he's had difficult staying on the field so far. Cager's injury could keep him out of Saturday's preseason contest on the road against Houston. ", " Ramiz Ahmed FAK News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 2:30 PM The Commanders waived Ahmed on Tuesday. Spin:Ahmed signed with the Commanders back in June and spent time competing with Riley Patterson at placekicker in training camp, but he's now been cut to make room for veteran wideout Martavis Bryant. The last time Ahmed logged NFL action was 2022, when he played one game with the Packers. ", " Shane Buechele BillsQB Injured Reserve News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 2:08 PM The Bills placed Buechele (neck) on injured reserve Tuesday. Spin:Buechele suffered a significant neck injury during Buffalo's preseason opener against the Bears. Unless he can reach an injury settlement with the team, Buechele will have to spend the entire 2024 campaign on IR with the Bills. ", " Marquise Brown ChiefsWR Doubtful News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 12:16 PM Brown (shoulder) is expected to miss 4-6 weeks due to a sternoclavicular injury suffered during Kansas City's preseason opener against the Jaguars, Jordan Schultz of BleacherReport.com reports. Spin:Brown's recovery timeline aligns with coach Andy Reid's earlier estimate, which was based on the amount of time former Kansas City wide receiver Tyreek Hill missed due to a similar injury in 2019. The timing makes it appear unlikely that Brown will be available for the regular-season opener against the Ravens on Thursday, Sept. 5, though the team has yet to rule him out. If Brown's recovery timeline ends up being closer to six weeks, he could even be a candidate to begin the year on IR. Given that Rashee Rice's legal issues and potential suspension are still pending, that leaves Xavier Worthy, Justin Watson, Skyy Moore and Kadarius Toney as the top wideout options sure to be available for Week 1. ", " MarShawn Lloyd PackersRB Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 8:15 AM Lloyd (hamstring) isn't practicing Tuesday, Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Spin:Coach Matt LaFleur declined to give a timeline for the rookie's return or provide details, merely informing reporters that Lloyd won't practice Tuesday after injuring his hamstring during Saturday's preseason game against Cleveland. The running back told reporters after the game that he'd pushed through a hamstring injury earlier in training camp, which is perhaps surprising given that his previous absences from practice (in late July) were attributed to a hip injury. Details aside, the mounting missed time this summer will only make it more difficult for Lloyd to earn a significant role early in the season, potentially opening the door for Emanuel Wilson to get snaps behind Josh Jacobs and AJ Dillon. ", " Martavis Bryant CommandersWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 13, 6:15 AM Bryant signed with the Commanders on Tuesday. Spin:The Cowboys signed Bryant to their practice squad in November, shortly after he was reinstated from an NFL suspension. He then signed a futures contract in January, only to be released in May before the start of offseason practices. The 32-year-old wideout last played in a regular-season game in 2018, making him unlikely to earn a significant role in Washington even though the team has a need at wide receiver behind No. 1 target Terry McLaurin. August 12 Ryan Miller BuccaneersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 8:19 PM Miller secured three of five targets for 42 yards in the Buccaneers' 17-14 preseason loss to the Bengals on Saturday night. Spin:The second-year pro set the pace for the Buccaneers in receptions and receiving yards while sharing the team lead in targets. Miller was on the practice squad in 2023 but did log two snaps from scrimmage and 12 special-teams snaps in one regular-season game, and his current push to land a deep reserve receiver spot certainly got off to a strong start with Saturday's performance. However, Miller will have to continue standing out to have any chance of that occurring, considering he has formidable competition in the form of Rakim Jarrett, among others. ", " Tyler Johnson RamsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 7:10 PM Johnson caught one of three targets for 11 yards during Sunday's 13-12 preseason victory against the Cowboys. Spin:After spending nearly the entirety of the 2023 campaign on the Rams' practice squad, Johnson failed to make much of an impression in his 2024 preseason debut. Jordan Whittington (6-74-0) stole the show among the wide receivers who did start for the Rams, and he, along with Puka Nacua (knee), Cooper Kupp, Demarcus Robinson and Tutu Atwell seem like safe locks for the 53-man roster. The fifth-year pro Johnson, along with Xavier Smith, Drake Stoops, Sam Wiglusz and JJ Laap, will spend the rest of the preseason battling it out for one or two final roster spots, with the slight edge going to Johnson and Smith at the moment. ", " Miller Forristall RamsTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 6:29 PM Forristall caught all three of his targets for 20 yards and a touchdown during Sunday's 13-12 preseason victory against the Cowboys. Spin:While still a long shot to make the roster with Tyler Higbee (knee), Colby Parkinson, Davis Allen and Hunter Long all likely to make the team, Forristall made the most of his opportunity by securing a game-winning six-yard touchdown pass from Stetson Bennett. Forristall led the Rams' tight ends with 24 snaps, with Allen (23) and Long (16) also seeing a small amount of action. Nikola Kalinic saw just eight snaps on the day and may serve as the primary competition for Forristall to make the final 53-man roster while Higbee recovers from a torn MCL and ACL. ", " Damiere Byrd BillsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 6:24 PM The Bills signed Byrd to a contract Monday, Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Byrd spent most of last season on Atlanta's practice squad, though he got into one game with the Falcons and logged 18 offensive snaps, recording zero catches on two targets. The veteran wideout's best NFL campaign came in 2020 with New England, when he caught 47 passes for 604 yards and a touchdown. Byrd also has experience as a kick and punt returner, though most of his work in that capacity came early in his career. He joins a Buffalo wide-receiver room that looks dramatically different than last season due to the departures of Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis. ", " Demetric Felton ColtsRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 5:54 PM The Colts claimed Felton off waivers Monday. Spin:Felton was waived by the Bears on Sunday after he lost a yard on one carry in Saturday's preseason game against the Bills. It didn't take long for the 2021 sixth-rounder to catch on with another team, and Felton will look to earn a spot on the Colts' 53-man roster as a depth running back. Indianapolis waived/injured Trent Pennix (groin) to make room on the training camp roster for Felton. ", " Austin Mack FAWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 5:52 PM Atlanta waived Mack on Monday, Marc Raimondi of ESPN reports. Spin:The Falcons made a pair of free-agent signings Monday, and Mack was cut loose to make room on the roster. He could eventually find his way back with Atlanta if he's not picked up by another team. ", " Jake Fromm LionsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 5:51 PM Fromm signed with the Lions on Monday. Spin:Fromm will head to Detroit after spending last season on Washington's practice squad. The 2020 fifth-round pick will now compete for the team's backup quarterback spot alongside Nate Sudfeld and Hendon Hooker (concussion). ", " Ben DiNucci BillsQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 5:36 PM The Bills signed DiNucci on Monday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Spin:With Shane Buechele set to miss extended time due to a neck injury he sustained in Saturday's preseason loss to the Bears, the Bills will bring in DiNucci to serve as the third quarterback behind Josh Allen and Mitch Trubisky. DiNucci was cut by the Broncos in May after Denver traded for Zach Wilson and selected Bo Nix 12th overall in the 2024 NFL Draft. ", " Justin Shorter BillsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 5:09 PM Shorter (knee) returned to practice Monday, Katherine Fitzgerald of The Buffalo News reports. Spin:Shorter is healthy once again after sitting out practice last week due to a knee injury. The 24-year-old will now compete for a roster spot as a backup receiver after missing the entirety of last season with a hamstring injury. ", " Jeremy McNichols CommandersRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 4:43 PM McNichols had three carries for 10 yards and one catch for eight yards in Saturday's preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:McNichols and Chris Rodriguez split snaps throughout the first half, after Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler were removed following the opening drive. It's a good sign for McNichols' chances of at least earning a spot on the practice squad, at which point he could be the injury replacement for Ekeler (while Rodriguez would be the natural fit to fill in for Robinson). McNichols spent most of last year on San Francisco's practice squad, and he's bounced around the league as a passing-down back and special-teams player ever since the Buccaneers took him in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. ", " Chris Rodriguez Jr. CommandersRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 4:38 PM Rodriguez took six carries for no gain and saw one incomplete target during Saturday's 20-17 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:It wasn't an ideal start to the preseason for Rodriguez, and not just because of the unfortunate stat line. He rotated with Jeremy McNichols once Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler were pulled from the game after the opening drive, hinting at a competition between Rodriguez and McNichols for the No. 3 job. Granted, it might not be an especially important distinction, with Rodriguez profiling as a possible replacement for Robinson and McNichols a more natural fit to fill in for Ekeler's role. Landing on the practice squad or gameday inactive list for Week 1 wouldn't necessarily preclude Rodriguez from taking on a significant role in the event of a Robinson injury. ", " Mike Gesicki BengalsTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 4:04 PM Gesicki (undisclosed) played eight offensive snaps during Saturday's 17-14 preseason loss to the Buccaneers. Spin:Gesicki missed some practice reps last week due to tightness, but he was cleared to suit up for a handful of plays during Cincinnati's preseason opener. He didn't record any stats during the exhibition matchup, but that means little in such a small sample. Gesicki is competing to solidify himself as the clear top pass-catching option in Cincinnati's tight end room, and his next chance to showcase his talents in preseason action will come Saturday on the road against Chicago. ", " Marvin Mims Jr. BroncosWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 2:13 PM Mims caught two of three targets for 17 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 34-30 preseason win over the Colts. Spin:Mims was on the field for just 17 offensive snaps Sunday, making the most of his opportunities by scoring a touchdown on a one-yard pass from Bo Nix late in the first half. With a strong showing in training camp thus far, the second-year wideout has a chance to take a big step forward in the Denver's offense after a disappointing rookie campaign. The 22-year-old's elite speed makes him an intriguing weapon with the potential to take the top off of defenses. With fellow receiver Courtland Sutton firmly atop the depth chart, Mims will likely compete with Josh Reynolds and Tim Patrick for the second spot in the pecking order. ", " Rashod Bateman RavensWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 10:59 AM Bateman (undisclosed) returned to practice Monday, Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic reports. Spin:Bateman, who exited last Monday's practice, didn't play in Friday's preseason opener, but the wideout now is back on the field, he'll have an opportunity to cement his key role in the Ravens' passing attack alongside fellow starting WR Zay Flowers. Assuming he can stay healthy, the 2021 first-rounder could be poised for a breakout effort in 2024 while working as one of QB Lamar Jackson's primary targets. ", " Mack Hollins BillsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 10:03 AM Hollins (leg) will practice Monday, Katherine Fitzgerald of The Buffalo News reports. Spin:Hollins missed Saturday's preseason contest against the Bears due to a lingering leg injury, but he's now ready to retake the practice field. The veteran journeyman is competing for the No. 4 wide receiver gig behind Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Curtis Samuel, so it would help Hollins' case if he's able to suit up and put forth a good showing during Saturday's upcoming road exhibition matchup at Pittsburgh. ", " Younghoe Koo FalconsK News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 9:34 AM Koo sported a sleeve on his kicking leg during Monday's practice, D. Orlando Ledbetter of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Spin:Koo made both of his attempts during Atlanta's preseason opener, including a 53-yarder in the third quarter. The reasoning behind the leg sleeve remains unclear, but Ledbetter noted that Koo missed a 51-yard attempt during Monday's practice. Koo hasn't missed a game over the past three seasons. ", " Luke Musgrave PackersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 8:16 AM Musgrave started and played seven snaps in Saturday's preseason opener against the Browns. Spin:Musgrave did not draw a target in Saturday's contest, but he also had very few opportunities to do so. Musgrave and fellow second-year player Tucker Kraft figure to handle the bulk of the tight-end duties for Green Bay, but Kraft is still getting up to speed after sustaining an offseason pectoral injury, so Musgrave has the upper hand at the moment. ", " Malik Heath PackersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 8:11 AM Heath was targeted four times and caught two passes for 22 yards in Saturday's preseason opener against the Browns. Spin:Heath did not draw a target until the second quarter of Saturday's contest, but he wound up playing 38 snaps -- the second most among Packers wideouts. Heath entered training camp as Green Bay's presumptive sixth option at the wide receiver spot, but he is being pushed for the spot by fellow sophomore Grant DuBose, who led the team in receiving Saturday. ", " Anders Carlson PackersK News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 7:03 AM Carlson made two field goals and an extra point in Saturday's preseason opener against the Browns. Spin:Accuracy was an issue for Carlson in his rookie season but not Saturday, as he made field goals from 46 and 33 yards as well as his lone extra-point attempt. Carlson remains locked in a competition with Greg Joseph for Green Bay's kicker job, and although the latter has fared a bit better during training camp, Carlson still has the advantage of having been selected by Green Bay in the sixth round of the 2023 draft. ", " Grant DuBose PackersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 12, 6:52 AM DuBose was targeted six times and caught five passes for 66 yards in Saturday's preseason opener against the Browns. Spin:DuBose had been something of an afterthought in Green Bay's deep receiver room, but he made a strong statement in the first preseason contest while leading the Packers in all of targets, receptions and receiving yardage. It will be tough for DuBose to really make a mark if his counterparts stay healthy, but he is in the mix with Malik Heath and Samori Toure for the sixth spot on the depth chart. August 11 Will Mallory ColtsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 9:03 PM Mallory had two receptions for 31 yards on two targets in Sunday's preseason loss to Denver. Spin:Mallory had missed time in training camp due to a sore hamstring but looked back to full speed. He's competing with Jelani Woods, Kylen Granson, Mo Alie-Cox and Drew Ogletree for playing time in a deep tight end room that lacks a clear No. 1 option. Indy's first preseason game did little to sort the competition other than all five are healthy. ", " Sam Ehlinger ColtsQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 8:51 PM Ehlinger was 5-of-6 passing for 80 yards with an interception in Sunday's preseason loss to Denver. He also had one carry for four yards. Spin:Ehlinger looks set win the third quarterback role and may not see any regular season action if Anthony Richardson and Joe Flacco are healthy. ", " Luke Schoonmaker CowboysTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 6:53 PM Schoonmaker saw two targets but failed to catch either one in Sunday's 13-12 preseason loss to the Rams. Spin:The second-year tight end had been dealing with a groin injury early in training camp, but he was deemed healthy enough to start Sunday while Jake Ferguson sat out the preseason opener along with the rest of the Cowboys' offensive starters. Schoonmaker didn't make any kind of impact, though, letting a short pass from Trey Lance go through his hands on the team's second drive before the duo failed to connect on a deep out on the next play. Schoonmaker's status as a second-round pick in 2023 gives him the edge on winning the No. 2 spot on the depth chart, but he's struggled to stay healthy to begin his career and could face a stiff challenge in camp from John Stephens. ", " Jalen Brooks CowboysWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 6:48 PM Brooks caught both his targets for 49 yards in Sunday's 13-12 preseason loss to the Rams. Spin:With CeeDee Lamb still holding out and Brandin Cooks and Jalen Tolbert both sitting this one out along with most of the Cowboys' other offensive starters, Brooks got the start at wideout and caught a 43-yard strike from Cooper Rush on the team's opening drive. The second-year wideout then hooked up with Trey Lance for a short completion on Dallas' second possession before Brooks called it a day. The South Carolina product appears to have a fairly firm hold on the No. 4 spot on the depth chart, but that job could become more interesting from a fantasy perspective if Lamb's absence extends into the regular season, or he isn't quite up to speed by Week 1. ", " Rodney Williams SteelersTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 5:47 PM Williams (shoulder) played 10 offensive snaps during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Williams suffered an AC sprain during practice in late July, but he was available for the Steelers' first preseason matchup. He wasn't targeted in the loss but will have two more opportunities during the preseason to make a case for a roster spot. ", " Stanley Morgan Jr. SaintsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 5:34 PM Morgan (hip) caught one of four targets for 13 yards during Saturday's 16-14 preseason win against the Cardinals. Spin:Morgan was dealing with a hip injury leading into Saturday's exhibition, but he managed to play 31 offensive snaps and should be healthy moving forward. The 27-year-old first got on the field in the second quarter and was out there for the final offensive series of the game, and he ended up tied with No.1 wideout Chris Olave and second-year wideout A.T. Perry for a team high in targets. Morgan's availability should help him in his goal of making the final 53-man roster, as fellow wideouts Equanimeous St. Brown (hamstring), Mason Tipton (hamstring) and Bub Means all did not play. ", " Marquez Callaway FAWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 3:23 PM The Saints cut Callaway on Sunday. Spin:The move is to make room on the Saints' 90-man training camp roster for wide receiver Shaquan Davis. After being let go by Pittsburgh in late July, Callaway returned to New Orleans on Aug. 1 after spending most of the 2023 season on the Saints' practice squad. He played 16 snaps (15 on offense, one on special teams) in Saturday's 16-14 preseason win over the Cardinals, but he was unable to convert on his lone target from quarterback Spencer Rattler late in the fourth quarter. Should he clear waviers, Callaway will look to earn a spot on another team that is in need of depth at wide receiver. ", " Jacob Saylors BrownsRB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 2:28 PM The Giants waived Saylors on Sunday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:After ending the 2023 season on the Falcons' injured reserve, Saylors caught on with the Giants in June. He played eight snaps in Thursday's 14-3 preseason win over the Lions, but all of them were on special teams. Saylors' path to the Giants' 53-man roster was always going to be a tough one, and the 23-year-old running back will now explore his next options assuming he clears waivers. ", " Spencer Brown FalconsRB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 1:37 PM The Falcons signed Brown to a contract Sunday. Spin:Brown was waived by the Panthers with an injury settlement in May due to an unspecified injury. He worked out with the Browns in July, and while nothing came from that, the 25-year-old running back is back to full health and will look to earn a spot on the Falcons' 53-man roster. Brown has appeared in three regular-season games since entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2021. ", " Nathan Rourke FAQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 1:31 PM The Falcons waived Rourke on Sunday. Spin:Rourke joined the Falcons on Aug. 1 after being waived by the Giants four days prior. He was brought in to compete with Taylor Heinicke for the No. 3 quarterback job, but Rourke struggled in Atlanta's 20-13 preseason loss to Miami, completing just three of 13 passes for 37 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions, though he did add 24 rushing yards on two carries. Should he clear waivers, Rourke will look for an opportunity to catch on with a team in need of an emergency quarterback. ", " Jimmy Garoppolo RamsQB Suspended News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 1:14 PM Garoppolo is not expected to play in Sunday's preseason game against the Cowboys, Cameron DaSilva of USA Today reports. Spin:Garoppolo did not appear among the quarterbacks suited up pregame, leaving Stetson Bennett as Dresser Winn to handle the Rams' signal-caller duties Sunday, according to Stu Jackson of the team's official site. Garoppolo is expected to serve as the No. 2 quarterback this season, though he'll still miss the first two regular-season games while serving a suspension for a violation of the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Therefore, Bennett and Winn are set to compete for the backup quarterback job to begin the 2024 campaign, so it's not too surprising that they'll be the ones under center for the team Sunday. Garoppolo's next chance to suit up this preseason will come during Saturday's exhibition against the Chargers. ", " Brandon Smith JetsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 11:12 AM Smith caught both of his targets for 70 yards in Saturday's 20-17 preseason win over the Commanders. Spin:Smith showed good chemistry with recent UFL MVP Adrian Martinez in the fourth quarter, as the pair connected for gains of 37 and 33 yards on deep balls. Neither the 25-year-old wide receiver nor the 24-year-old quarterback are likely to land a roster spot with the Jets, but both are realistic practice squad candidates and improved their chances of making it with Saturday's strong performances. Smith should continue to see run with the depth pieces on offense throughout the preseason, with his next chance to take the field coming next Saturday in Carolina. ", " Jason Brownlee JetsWR News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 11:01 AM Brownlee caught one of two targets for a 12-yard touchdown in Saturday's 20-17 preseason win over the Commanders. Spin:Brownlee couldn't come down with a contested deep ball from Tyrod Taylor in the first quarter but caught a fade in the end zone from Andrew Peasley for a 12-yard touchdown in the second. Brownlee appeared in seven games for the Jets in 2023 after signing with the team as an undrafted free agent, but he finds himself on the roster bubble heading into 2024 after the team bolstered its receiving corps in the offseason. This was a promising start in Brownlee's quest to make the team, and he'll look to build off this performance next Saturday against the Panthers. ", " Tyrod Taylor JetsQB News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 10:59 AM Taylor completed one of two passes for minus-1 yard in Saturday's 20-17 preseason win over the Commanders. Spin:Taylor played the first two drives with the Jets holding out most of their starters, including Aaron Rodgers. The veteran backup didn't do much of note in his Jets debut, but Taylor isn't in any danger of losing the backup role to Jordan Travis (ankle) or Andrew Peasley, the latter of whom threw a touchdown pass on the next drive after Taylor exited the game. Taylor will likely see more extensive action in Saturday's preseason game against the Panthers. ", " Jack Stoll GiantsTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 11, 9:47 AM Stoll (concussion) has been cleared to resume practicing, Dan Salomone of the Giants' official site reports. Spin:The tight end is competing for a depth role behind presumptive starter Daniel Bellinger. Stoll spent his first three seasons with the Eagles and caught 19 passes. August 10 Cedric Tillman BrownsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 11:07 PM Tillman caught one of two targets for three yards in Saturday's 23-10 preseason loss to the Packers. Spin:While he didn't make much of an impact, Tillman got the start for Cleveland and both his targets came on the team's opening drive with Jameis Winston under center. The offseason addition of Jerry Jeudy (leg) pushed Tillman down the depth chart at wide receiver, but the 2023 third-round pick still has a chance to overtake Elijah Moore for the No. 3 spot before the regular season begins. ", " Jameis Winston BrownsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 10:52 PM Winston completed four of five passes for 30 yards in Saturday's 23-10 preseason loss to the Packers. Spin:The veteran quarterback led the Browns' offensive starters to a field goal on the team's first possession, but Cleveland wouldn't score again until the fourth quarter. Winston was working without any of the Browns' top targets, instead connecting with the likes of Cedric Tillman, David Bell (quadriceps) and Michael Woods before handing the reins over to Tyler Huntley. Winston will head into Week 1 as the primary backup to Deshaun Watson, a job that could result in him seeing more action than expected considering Watson has played only 12 total games over the prior two seasons. ", " Dontayvion Wicks PackersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 9:51 PM Wicks caught his only target for 65 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 23-10 preseason win over the Browns. Spin:The second-year wideout was on the other end of a downfield strike from Jordan Love on the Packers' first possession, and both players called it a day after that. Wicks is jockeying for snaps and targets this season with Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed in a crowded Green Bay receiving corps, and showing strong chemistry with Love in the preseason can only help his standing. ", " Josh Jacobs PackersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 9:38 PM Jacobs gained seven yards on his only carry and caught his only target for a two-yard loss in Saturday's 23-10 preseason win over the Browns. Spin:The running back dealt with a minor groin injury earlier in the week, but Jacobs was healthy for the Packers' preseason opener and played one series before calling it a day. The former Raider has topped 1,100 scrimmage yards in each of his first five seasons in the NFL, but Green Bay's coaching staff has suggested Jacobs will be used a little more frequently as a receiver during his first season with his new club. Jacobs could see a bigger workload in next Sunday's preseason clash with the Broncos as he gets ready for Week 1. ", " Trent Sherfield Sr. VikingsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 8:54 PM Sherfield had three receptions for 46 yards on six targets, including a 33-yard touchdown, in Saturday's preseason win over Las Vegas. Spin:Sherfield is competing for the fourth or fifth receiver role among a crowded field that includes Brandon Powell, Trishton Jackson, Lucky Jackson and Thayer Thomas. The veteran may have a lead on a roster spot at this point in the preseason. ", " Brandon Allen 49ersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 8:04 PM Allen completed seven of 13 pass attempts for 98 yards while getting the nod under center in Saturday's preseason tilt against Tennessee. Spin:San Francisco rested most of its starting offense Saturday, allowing Allen to start the first half and journeyman backup Joshua Dobbs to handle the remaining snaps. The latter (14-of-20 for 146 yards) looked better in the competition to be Brock Purdy's backup, but Allen had to face the opponent's starting defense and was also saddled with two incompletions due to drops. Neither signal-caller will be on fantasy radars come Week 1, as Purdy will be running the well-oiled machine that is the 49ers' offense when the regular season kicks off. ", " Calvin Ridley TitansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 7:47 PM Ridley had one reception off of two targets for 22 yards in Saturday's 17-13 preseason win over the 49ers. Spin:Ridley was able to rip off a big gain with his new club when he took a short pass and made a couple of defenders miss in the open field. The 30-year-old wound up seeing two of starting quarterback Will Levis' five targets in the exhibition win. The Titans were without the services of DeAndre Hopkins (knee) on Saturday, and Hopkins is expected to miss at least a few more weeks with a knee injury. Ridley handled the No. 1 wideout role in the veteran's stead, but he figures to start alongside Nuk once the latter is cleared to return. ", " Hayden Hurst ChargersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 7:43 PM Hurst did not catch his lone reception in Saturday's 16-3 preseason loss against the Seahawks. Spin:Backup quarterback Easton Stick threw a woefully errant first-half pass to Hurst, who valiantly tried to make a stupendous catch only to be decimated by an incoming defender, popping the ball up in the air for an interception. The veteran did linger on the ground for a bit after the play, but he was able to jog off on his own. Hurst is expected to work in tandem with fellow free-agent addition Will Dissly to operate as a multi-faceted platoon tight end group, with the 6-foot-8 Donald Parham also mixing in on occasion. ", " Tony Pollard TitansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 7:19 PM Pollard rushed four times for 35 yards and a caught both of his targets for 11 yards in Saturday's 17-13 win over the 49ers. Spin:Pollard was the first back utilized in Saturday's preseason opener and wound up leading the team with six combined touches for 46 yards. Tyjae Spears finished with just four total yards on four touches in the exhibition win, but he scored the only rushing touchdown out of the duo. Pollard showed good burst and acceleration in his brief debut Saturday, and he remains the preferred fantasy target out of Tennessee's backfield as we enter draft season. ", " Devin Culp BuccaneersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 5:59 PM Culp (head) returned to Saturday's game against the Bengals, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. Spin:Culp was evaluated for a concussion at the end of the first half, but he appears to have passed the test and is back on the field for the third quarter. The rookie seventh-round draft pick is competing with Payne Durham and Ko Kieft for a backup tight end role behind starter Cade Otton. ", " Joshua Palmer ChargersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 3:38 PM Palmer is not expected to play in Saturday's preseason opener against the Seahawks, Daniel Popper of The Athletic reports. Spin:The team is likely to keep a number of its clear starters on the sideline to kick off the preseason. Expect to see plenty of Quentin Johnston and Brenden Rice as the young wide receivers look to continue improving in the exhibition contests. ", " Ben Sinnott CommandersTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 12:57 PM Sinnott caught all three of his targets for 57 yards in Saturday's 20-17 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:Sinnott is expected to begin his career as a depth option behind veteran Zach Ertz, who got a day off Saturday. Sinnott got free down the seam for a 44-yard catch in the second quarter, but it's worth noting that all of his production came with third- and fourth-string quarterbacks Jeff Driskel and Sam Hartman in the game rather than Jayden Daniels or Marcus Mariota, who played one drive apiece. While this was a promising NFL debut for the rookie tight end, the 2024 second-round pick still needs to work his way up the depth chart in order to get opportunities with Washington's starters. Sinnott should see plenty of playing time in next Saturday's preseason game against the Dolphins. ", " Kevin Harris PatriotsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 8:46 AM Harris carried eight times for 22 yards and a TD and caught one of his three targets for six yards in Thursday's 17-3 preseason win over the Panthers. Spin:In his latest 53-man roster projection, Evan Lazar of the Patriots' official site predicts that Harris will stick as the team's No. 3 running back to begin the coming season behind Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson. Per Lazar, Harris -- a 2022 sixth-rounder -- \"won't 'wow' you with elusiveness or pass-catching ability, but he runs hard between the tackles and has displayed better vision working off zone blocks.\" Also competing for depth slotting in New England's backfield are JaMycal Hasty and Terrell Jennings, and one or both could potentially end up on the practice squad following cut-downs. ", " Cam Akers TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:55 AM Akers carried six times for 17 yards and caught all three targets for 24 yards in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over the Steelers. He also returned one kickoff for 23 yards. Spin:Akers followed up an effective Hall of Fame Game and is showing no ill effects of the knee injury that wiped out the second half of the 2023 season. The Texans added him to the roster when they learned Joe Mixon (quadriceps) was dealing with an injury, so his stay on the roster could last as long as it takes Mixon to heal. All of Akers' 15 offensive snaps came during the second half. ", " Robert Woods TexansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:49 AM Woods caught all four targets for 42 yards in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over Pittsburgh. Spin:Woods made his preseason debut and led all Houston receivers in yards. If healthy, Woods is expected to be the team's fourth wideout. ", " Ka'imi Fairbairn TexansK News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:42 AM Fairbairn was successful on two of three field-goal attempts and converted both extra-point kicks in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over the Steelers. Spin:Fairbairn calmly drilled a 36-yarder at the end of the first half, then connected from 51 yards in the third quarter. His miss was wide left from 32 yards. Fairbairn's in no danger of losing the placekicking job for a team that's expected to produce a lot of offense and points. ", " Tim Boyle TexansQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:38 AM Boyle completed four of eight attempts for 28 yards in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over Pittsburgh. Spin:Boyle was the third quarterback used following C.J. Stroud and Davis Mills. That he was used ahead of the 36-year-old Case Keenum likely doesn't suggest a change in the depth chart. ", " J.J. Taylor TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:23 AM Taylor had one carry for three yards, returned one punt for 10 yards and had a kickoff return for 29 yards in Friday's 20-12 win over the Steelers. Spin:Taylor was the third back in the game, with his lone carry coming late in the first half. That places him ahead of Cam Akers and Jawhar Jordan, both of whom played in the second half. Taylor was one of five players to return a punt or kickoff but was the lone player given opportunities for both. ", " Jawhar Jordan TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:18 AM Jordan had six carries for 22 yards in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over Pittsburgh. Spin:Jordan led the Texans in rushing, but it was all accumulated in the fourth quarter, which indicates a long climb to win a roster spot. He was used as a returner on kickoffs in the Hall of Fame Game last week but did not get that opportunity Friday. ", " Dare Ogunbowale TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 10, 6:15 AM Ogunbowale rushed three times for 10 yards and a touchdown in Friday's 20-12 preseason win over Steelers. Spin:The Texans couldn't get much going with their run game, but Ogunbowale had an easy four-yard scamper for a score. He was the second back in the game following Dameon Pierce, who started in place of Joe Mixon (quadriceps). That suggests Ogunbowale will be Houston's third back to start the season. August 9 La'Mical Perine SteelersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 11:46 PM Perine rushed four times for 10 yards while failing to secure his lone target during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Perine signed a one-year contract with the Steelers in May, but he wasn't particularly efficient during Friday's preseason opener. It's unclear whether he'll be able to land a spot on the team's 53-man roster this year, but even if he's included on the active roster, he's unlikely to see much regular-season work since the Steelers also have Najee Harris, Jaylen Warren and Cordarrelle Patterson. ", " Calvin Austin III SteelersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 11:43 PM Austin secured two of his three targets for 49 yards during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Austin had a limited impact on offense in 2023, securing 17 of 30 targets for 180 yards and a touchdown while rushing 11 times for 57 yards and another score. However, the Steelers lost Diontae Johnson, Allen Robinson and Miles Boykin during the offseason, so there should be more targets available during the 2024 campaign. Austin impressed during OTAs and minicamp this spring and has carried that momentum into the start of training camp, showcasing his versatility by lining up on the outside as well as in the slot. While the Steelers also have several other receivers competing for targets during the preseason, Austin had a strong start Friday by leading the team in receiving yards. ", " Scotty Miller SteelersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 11:33 PM Miller secured three of four targets for 47 yards during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Miller joined the Steelers on a one-year deal in May and is competing for a depth role at wide receiver after the team lost Diontae Johnson, Allen Robinson and Miles Boykin during the offseason. Miller made a solid first impression during Friday's preseason opener, as he tied for the team lead in receptions and finished second in receiving yards, fueled by a 38-yard catch to begin the fourth quarter. The 2019 sixth-rounder appeared in all 17 regular-season games during his lone season in Atlanta last year but secured just 11 of his 16 targets for 161 yards and two touchdowns. He hasn't topped 200 receiving yards in a season since the 2020 campaign in which he was catching passes from Tom Brady in Tampa Bay, so even if Miller lands a spot on the Steelers' 53-man roster this year, he seems unlikely to be an appealing fantasy option. ", " Kyle Allen SteelersQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 11:15 PM Allen completed 17 of 23 pass attempts for 193 yards, a touchdown and an interception while rushing once for 11 yards during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Justin Fields drew the start during Friday's preseason opener, but Allen saw most of the playing time under center. He led the team to two scores in the second half and completed four passes of at least 24 yards. Despite Friday's solid showing, Allen will have to continue competing for a roster spot as a backup as the preseason progresses since the Steelers also have Fields and Russell Wilson as options at quarterback. ", " Dez Fitzpatrick SteelersWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 11:01 PM Fitzpatrick secured his lone target for 34 yards during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to Houston. Spin:Fitzpatrick signed a reserve/future contract with the Steelers in January, and he made a flashy play during Friday's preseason opener with a 34-yard reception in the second quarter, the team's second-longest play of the night. He spent the entire 2023 season on Pittsburgh's practice squad and faces an uphill battle to earn a spot on the team's 53-man roster for the 2024 campaign, even after the Steelers lost Diontae Johnson, Allen Robinson and Miles Boykin during the offseason. ", " Connor Heyward SteelersTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 10:55 PM Heyward secured both of his targets for four yards and a touchdown during Friday's 20-12 preseason loss to the Texans. Spin:Heyward wasn't a consistent part of the Steelers' passing game last year, as he secured 23 of 34 targets for 167 yards over 17 regular-season games. However, he had a six-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter of Friday's preseason opener. Although it was encouraging to see Heyward reach the end zone against Houston, he's unlikely to be a reliable contributor during the regular season, as he remains behind Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington on the Steelers' depth chart at tight end. ", " Taylor Heinicke FalconsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:45 PM Heinicke completed four of 11 passes for 11 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions and netted no gain on two carries in the Falcons' 20-13 preseason loss to the Dolphins on Friday night. He also fumbled once but recovered. Spin:Heinicke was the second quarterback in after rookie eighth overall pick Michael Penix, entering the game with 6:34 remaining in the second quarter. The veteran signal-caller was partly victimized by playing with second- and third-string offensive linemen and skill players, helping explain his forgettable passing line. Nevertheless, Heinicke appears to still have a clear lead in his battle with recent arrival Nathan Rourke for the No. 3 quarterback job, and both players should once again see time in the Falcons' second exhibition game Aug. 17 against the Ravens. ", " Casey Washington FalconsWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:40 PM Washington secured three of nine targets for 27 yards in the Falcons' 20-13 preseason loss to the Dolphins on Friday night. He also recovered a fumble. Spin:While he posted an inefficient line overall, Washington was the subject of plenty of attention from the Falcons' quarterbacks while garnering team-high reception and target totals. The rookie sixth-round pick was the beneficiary of so much opportunity thanks in large part to Drake London, Darnell Mooney and Ray-Ray McCloud all being held out of action, but Washington should still get an opportunity to make his case for a roster spot during the Falcons' second exhibition game against the Ravens on Aug. 17. ", " Josh Johnson RavensQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:11 PM Johnson completed four of 12 passes for 62 yards and gained 11 rushing yards on two carries in Friday's 16-13 preseason loss to the Eagles. Spin:The defenses were ahead of the offenses for both teams, but Johnson in particular struggled to move the ball as he got the start while Lamar Jackson and the rest of the Ravens' first-team offense got the night off. The 38-year-old journeyman is set as Jackson's backup in his second stint with Baltimore, but Johnson would offer little fantasy upside if he were forced into action in the regular season. ", " Kenneth Gainwell EaglesRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:01 PM Gainwell carried the ball four times for 23 yards in Friday's 16-13 preseason win over the Ravens. Spin:Reporting earlier in the day suggested that Saquon Barkley and the Eagles' first-team offense would get a series at the beginning of the game, but instead Gainwell got the start in the backfield and played the first handful of snaps before giving way to Will Shipley on Philadelphia's second possession. Gainwell's experience in Nick Sirianni's system has him penciled into the No. 2 spot on the running back depth chart behind Barkley, but the team used a fourth-round pick in this year's draft on Shipley, and the rookie found the end zone Friday as he builds a case to take over the top backup job. ", " Jashaun Corbin FARB Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 3:53 PM The Giants waived Corbin (undisclosed) from injured reserve with an injury settlement Friday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Corbin was waived with an undisclosed injury Monday, and he reverted to IR for the Giants after going unclaimed on waivers Tuesday. Now that he's secured an injury settlement, Corbin will be eligible to sign elsewhere in the league this season once back to full health. ", " Josh Pederson FATE Questionable News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 3:43 PM The Jaguars waived Pederson (ankle) from injured reserve Friday with an injury settlement, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Pederson's injury settlement frees him up to sign with another team, when healthy, rather than having to spend the entire 2024 season on IR with Jacksonville. He spent most of last season on the Jaguars' practice squad and failed to record any stats across three appearances with the team. ", " Cordarrelle Patterson SteelersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 2:37 PM Patterson (hamstring) was activated by the Steelers on Friday as he passed his physical, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Patterson was placed on the reserve/non-football back in late July, but the passing of a physical was enough for him to now get activated. The veteran running back and return specialist will likely see the bulk of his opportunities this season as the Steelers' kick returner, as he sits behind Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren in the backfield depth chart. ", " JuJu Smith-Schuster FAWR News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 10:36 AM The Patriots have released Smith-Schuster. Spin:Smith-Schuster, who logged 11 snaps without a target in Thursday's preseason opener, will now have an opportunity to catch on elsewhere on the heels of a 2023 campaign in which he recorded a 29-260-1 line on 47 targets in 11 regular-season contests. By parting ways with the 27-year-old, the Patriots now have one less option to consider in what remains a crowded wideout corps. ", " Bailey Zappe PatriotsQB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:53 AM Zappe completed 12 of his 20 pass attempts for 108 yards and ran once for six yards in Thursday's 17-3 preseason win over the Panthers. Spin:Per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, Zappe logged a team-high 36 snaps among the Patriots' QBs in the team's exhibition opener, while top options Jacoby Brissett (four snaps) and Drake Maye (six snaps) both saw limited action in the contest. At this stage, Zappe is competing with rookie sixth-rounder Joe Milton for depth slotting, with Chad Graff of The Athletic suggesting that in the current context Zappe seems unlikely to make New England's 53-man roster. ", " Jake Bates LionsK News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:39 AM Bates made his only field-goal attempt in Thursday's 14-3 loss to the Giants. Spin:Bates was able to capitalize on his only opportunity Thursday, nailing a 53-yard field goal to give the Lions an early 3-0 lead. The 25-year-old signed with Detroit in June, and he appears to be the featured kicker with the team in 2024 after expected starter Michael Badgley (hamstring) suffered a season-ending injury. ", " Jordan Matthews PanthersTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:16 AM Matthews caught all three of his targets for 48 yards during Thursday's 17-3 preseason loss to the Patriots. Spin:The Panthers are desperate for a tight end that can be a vertical threat, and they may have found a hidden gem in the former Eagles wideout. Matthews (19 snaps) played behind rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders (24 snaps) during Thursday's contest, but Matthews outperformed him, as Sanders failed to even see a target. With Carolina's tight-end corps being one of the weakest units in football over the last few seasons, Matthews could find his way onto the team's 53-man roster if he continues to impress. ", " Mike Boone PanthersRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 8:07 AM Boone rushed eight times for 34 yards while also catching three of his four targets for 17 yards during Thursday's 17-3 preseason loss to the Patriots. Spin:Boone helped his chances of making the Panthers' 53-man roster Thursday by recording 51 yards from scrimmage while playing the most snaps (30) of any Carolina running back. The seventh-year pro saw that many opportunities due to Carolina resting its top three healthy RBs: Chuba Hubbard, Miles Sanders and Raheem Blackshear. Nonetheless, Boone outshined both Dillon Johnson and Jaden Shirden and now likely now has a chance of making it past the Panthers' final roster cuts. ", " John Stephens Jr. CowboysTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 9, 7:22 AM Stephens has had a strong training camp so far and is pushing for the No. 2 spot on the Cowboys' tight end depth chart, Jon Machota and Saad Yousef of The Athletic report. Spin:Jake Ferguson is locked into the starting job, but after that the Dallas depth chart is unsettled. Luke Schoonmaker was a second-round pick in 2023 but has had trouble staying healthy to begin his career and is already battling a groin issue in camp. Peyton Hendershot (shoulder) has shown flashes as a pass-catching option but is also not 100 percent healthy. That's opened up reps for Stephens, a converted wide receiver who was an undrafted free agent in 2023 but made a good early impression last year before suffering a torn ACL in the preseason that cost him the entire campaign. Fully recovered from the knee injury, Stephens has seen reps with the first-team offense and looks capable of providing solid depth behind Ferguson. August 8 Jalin Hyatt GiantsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 8:16 PM Hyatt caught his only target for no gain in Thursday's 14-3 preseason win over the Lions. Spin:Hyatt's lone target came from Drew Lock (hip) on the opening drive. Rookie sixth overall pick Malik Nabers wasn't targeted at all on his 12 snaps in the game, so neither of the young speedsters made much of an impact Thursday. Hyatt's coming off a 373-yard rookie season, and the 2023 third-round draft pick is trying to carve out a larger role in 2024. The Giants' second preseason game will be next Saturday in Houston. ", " Daniel Bellinger GiantsTE News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 8:15 PM Bellinger caught one of two targets for seven yards in Thursday's 14-3 preseason win over the Lions. Spin:Bellinger wasn't heavily involved but neither was rookie fourth-round pick Theo Johnson, who wasn't targeted Thursday. Tyree Jackson was the Giants' most productive tight end Thursday with two catches for 34 yards, but Bellinger and Johnson have been splitting first-team reps in practice and remain on track to lead the position come the regular season. New York's next preseason game will be in Houston next Saturday. ", " Tommy DeVito GiantsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 7:46 PM DeVito completed eight of 15 passes for 92 yards without a touchdown or interception in Thursday's 14-3 preseason win over the Lions. He added four rushing attempts for two yards. Spin:Daniel Jones didn't suit up and Drew Lock exited late in the first quarter due to a hip injury, leaving DeVito to play the remainder of the game. DeVito proceeded to lead two touchdown drives in the second quarter, both of which were capped by Eric Gray rushing scores. While DeVito started six games as a rookie and looked marginally sharper than Lock on Thursday, the second-year quarterback is still expected to open the season third on the depth chart behind Jones and Lock. DeVito will likely see significant playing time in next Saturday's preseason game against the Texans. ", " Joe Milton III PatriotsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 7:33 PM Milton completed four of six passes for 54 yards and a touchdown and added five rushes for 22 yards in the Patriots' 17-3 preseason win over the Panthers on Thursday. Spin:Milton entered the game with 4:01 remaining in the third quarter and got off on the right foot with a five-yard completion to fellow rookie Javon Baker. Milton went on to record a memorable 13-yard scramble during that initial possession before capping off his second drive with a 38-yard touchdown pass to JaQuae Jackson at the 9:00 minute mark of the fourth quarter. Milton is battling incumbent Bailey Zappe, who was solid in his own right Thursday while throwing for 108 yards, for the No. 3 quarterback job. Nevertheless, Milton at least makes the competition a bit more intriguing with this debut effort, and the rookie sixth-round pick could certainly get a more extensive platform to make his case in the Patriots' second preseason game next Thursday night against the Eagles. ", " Antonio Gibson PatriotsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 7:27 PM Gibson rushed four times for four yards and brought in his only target for 13 yards in the Patriots' 17-3 preseason win over the Panthers on Thursday. Spin:The veteran back's team debut included the distinction of being on the receiving end of rookie third overall pick Drake Maye's first professional completion. Gibson unsurprisingly ceded the first series to Rhamondre Stevenson, who's projected to serve as the Patriots' clear lead back this coming season while the former acts in more of a third-down/pass-catching capacity. ", " Tommy Hudson FATE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 3:12 PM The Saints waived Hudson (undisclosed) from IR with an injury settlement Thursday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Hudson was waived with an unspecified injury designation last Thursday, and he was in danger of missing the whole 2024 season after reverting to the team's IR one day later. With the injury settlement, however, the 27-year-old tight end will have an opportunity to sign with another team once he's fully healthy. Hudson spent all of 2023 on the Saints' practice squad, and his only NFL action came in 2021 with the Titans, when he recorded three catches for 31 yards across five-regular season outings. ", " Stephen Sullivan FATE Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 3:08 PM The Panthers released Sullivan (quadriceps) from injured reserve with an injury settlement Thursday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Sullivan was set to miss all of 2024 after landing on Carolina's injured reserve last Thursday, but the 27-year-old will now have the opportunity to catch on with another team once he's fully healthy. The 2020 seventh-round tight end out of LSU played in 11 regular-season games for the Panthers last season, posting 12 catches on 24 targets for 125 yards. ", " Malik Turner FAWR Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 3:00 PM The 49ers released Turner from injured reserve with an injury settlement Thursday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Turner was placed on San Francisco's injured reserve Tuesday with an unspecified injury, and he was set to miss the entire 2024 campaign until reaching a settlement two days later. Once healthy, the 28-year-old wide receiver out of Illinois will look to catch onto another team's roster, most likely on the practice squad. ", " Keilan Robinson JaguarsRB Questionable News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 2:51 PM Robinson (toe) has been ruled out of the Jaguars' preseason opener against the Chiefs on Saturday, Demetrius Harvey of The Florida Times-Union reports. Spin:Robinson has been dealing with a toe injury since July 31, and since then he's been limited to individual drills. The rookie fifth-round running back is competing against Tank Bigsby and D'Ernest Johnson for the backup spot behind Travis Etienne. Robinson will work to be available for the Jaguars' second preseason game against the Buccaneers on Aug. 17. ", " Robbie Chosen 49ersWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 2:44 PM Chosen agreed to terms on a contract with the 49ers on Thursday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Spin:Chosen, who caught four passes in nine games for the Dolphins in 2023, now lands in San Francisco as a depth provision while Brandon Aiyuk's ongoing trade-request saga unfurls. Despite his ample experience in the NFL, the 31-year-old faces a difficult path to earning a roster spot with the 49ers, even if Aiyuk were to be dealt without San Francisco adding another notable wideout in return. ", " Nick Foles FAQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 8:13 AM Foles announced his retirement from professional football Thursday via social media. Spin:Best remembered for leading Philadelphia to its first Super Bowl championship during the 2017 season and taking home the game's MVP honors in the 41-33 win over the Patriots, Foles will will officially retire as a member of the Eagles during the team's Sept. 16 home opener versus the Falcons. Selected by the Eagles in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft, Foles tied a single-game NFL record with seven passing touchdowns in a game against the Raiders in 2013 during his first stint in Philadelphia, then matched another NFL record with 25 consecutive completions in a game in 2018 during his second stint with the team. In addition to his two stints with Philadelphia, Foles also suited up for the Rams, Chiefs, Jaguars, Bears and Colts during an 11-year NFL career. August 7 Peyton Hendershot CowboysTE Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 4:35 PM Hendershot was unavailable for the Cowboys' practice Wednesday due to a shoulder injury, Todd Archer of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Hendershot was forced to sit out the team's \"mock game\" at practice as the Cowboys gear up for their first preseason contest Sunday on the road versus the Rams. The tight end will look to get back on the practice field as soon as possible, though he may not be able to go Sunday depending on the severity of his shoulder issue. ", " Armani Rogers EaglesTE News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 2:17 PM The Eagles claimed Rogers off waivers on Wednesday. Spin:Rogers, who missed the entire 2023 season due to a torn Achilles tendon, was waived by the Commanders on Tuesday and now finds a new home in Philadelphia. He faces long odds to make the Eagles' active roster, but an impressive showing in training camp could allow Rogers to earn a spot on the practice squad. ", " Deon Jackson JetsRB News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 2:08 PM Jackson signed a contract with the Jets on Wednesday. Spin:Jackson bounced between the Colts, Browns and Giants last season, seeing action in four regular-season games. The Duke product managed to net only 16 yards on 14 carries, but he did have a little better success in 2022, when he averaged 3.5 YPC on 68 attempts. The 25-year-old will compete with rookies Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis, as well as with second-year pro Israel Abanikanda, for a spot behind Breece Hall at running back. ", " Deonte Harty RavensWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 1:29 PM Harty (lower leg) was spotted participating in Wednesday's practice, Jonas Shaffer of TheBaltimoreBanner.com reports. Spin:Harty missed a little time due to a soft tissue injury in his lower leg, but it appears he's moved past the issue. Now that Harty has returned to full health, he's expected to serve as the Ravens' top kick and punt returner and compete for a depth role in the team's wide receiver room. ", " Ke'Shawn Vaughn 49ersRB News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 1:16 PM The 49ers signed Vaughn on Wednesday, Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com reports. Spin:The 2020 third-round pick out of Vanderbilt spent the first four seasons of his career in Tampa Bay and has now agreed to terms with San Francisco. Vaughn is expected to add depth to a 49ers running back room dealing with injuries to Christian McCaffrey (calf), Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) and Isaac Guerendo (hamstring). ", " Andy Isabella BillsWR News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 11:18 AM Isabella (leg) returned to practice Wednesday, Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic reports. Spin:Isabella was able to make a quick recovery after being carted off the field Monday. The 27-year-old is likely facing an uphill battle to make the Bills' final 53-man roster, but his speedy return to the field should keep him in contention for now. ", " Rondale Moore FalconsWR Injured Reserve News Archive \t THU, AUG 8, 12:27 PM The Falcons placed Moore (knee) on injured reserve Thursday, ruling him out for the entire 2024 campaign, Terrin Waack of the Falcons' official site reports. Spin:Moore was carted off the field due to what was reported as a non-contact knee injury during Wednesday's joint practice with the Dolphins, and Adam Schefter of ESPN confirms that the issue is severe enough to rule him out for the year. It's brutal timing for the 2021 second-round pick, who was traded to Atlanta earlier this offseason and had an opportunity to revitalize his career under new Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson. Moore will now turn his attention toward recovering for the 2025 season, while Ray-Ray McCloud now seems to have a clearer path to the No. 3 wide receiver spot. ", " Tucker Kraft PackersTE Questionable News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 7:40 AM Kraft (pectoral) said Tuesday that he expects to be ready for the Packers' Week 1 game against Philadelphia, Ryan Wood of USA Today reports. Spin:Kraft suffered a pectoral tear early in the offseason and has been limited to individual drills at training camp since the Packers activated him from the PUP list Monday. The second-year tight end has more than a month to gear up for the season opener, and at this point, his role seems to be more of a question than his availability, as the Packers have fellow 2023 draft pick Luke Musgrave at tight end. Musgrave was the starter for most of last season and had plenty of promising moments, but Kraft had better receiving numbers when he got his chance to start, filling in late in the season while Musgrave recovered from a serious kidney injury. The Packers might even deploy a rotation rather than settling on one player as the clear No. 1 tight end. ", " Mo Alie-Cox ColtsTE News Archive \t WED, AUG 7, 7:13 AM Alie-Cox is listed as one of two starting tight ends on Indianapolis' first unofficial depth chart of the preseason, Amanda Foster of the Colts' official site reports. Spin:Kylen Granson is listed as a starter at tight end along with Alie-Cox, who would function primarily as a blocker if the two were to share the field together. Though the 6-foot-5, 267-pound Alie-Cox still presents a big target in the red zone, his involvement in the passing game has faded over the past two seasons. He had just 22 targets in 17 games in 2023, finishing with 13 receptions for 161 yards and three touchdowns. August 6 Cam Sims FAWR Questionable News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 5:50 PM The Panthers released Sims (undisclosed) from the reserve/PUP list with an injury settlement Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:After being placed on the active/PUP list at the start of training camp with an unspecified injury, Sims was moved to the reserve/PUP list July 26. Now that he's reached an injury settlement, he will have the opportunity to join another team once he is fully healthy. His last NFL action was in 2022 with the Commanders, when he recorded eight catches on 18 targets for 89 yards across 17 regular-season games. ", " Jalen Camp FAWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 5:34 PM The Browns waived Camp on Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Camp joined the Browns in May after being waived by the Panthers, but the 26-year-old wide receiver will now be on the lookout for a new team should he clear waivers. Camp didn't play in 2023, and he has played in just five regular-season games since being drafted in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft. ", " Dax Milne RaidersWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 3:52 PM Milne agreed to a deal with the Raiders on Tuesday, Vic Tafur of The Athletic reports. Spin:Milne spent all of 2023 on injured reserve due to a groin injury, and he was waived by the Commanders on July 31. The 2021 seventh-round pick played in 15 regular-season games with Washington in 2022, registering six catches for 37 yards and one touchdown while adding 611 total return yards. Milne's return experience could help him earn a spot on the Raiders' 53-man roster at the conclusion of training camp. ", " Khari Blasingame BearsRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 3:32 PM Blasingame carried the football eight times last year, giving him 11 rushing attempts over his five-year career. Spin:In 2023, Blasingame handled all eight of his rushing attempts in a game during which the Bears suffered multiple injuries at running back. The fullback is a solid blocker, but there are no indications that the veteran will be in position to have more than a few carries or targets in 2024. ", " Tanner McKee EaglesQB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 3:31 PM Eliot Shorr-Parks of Sports Radio 94 WIP Philadelphia relays that McKee has gotten more reps with the second-team offense as the Eagles' training camp has progressed. Spin:McKee, who the Eagles selected in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft, spent all of his rookie year as the emergency quarterback. While Philadelphia acquired Kenny Pickett from Pittsburgh in March to serve as Jalen Hurts' backup, Moore has shown enough improvement during training camp to see more reps with the second-team offense during practice. The Eagles play the Ravens in the first week of preseason action Friday, which will give McKee a chance to make his case for the backup job behind Hurts. ", " Elijah Moore BrownsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 2:20 PM Moore (concussion) participated in team drills Tuesday, Mary Kay Cabot of The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. Spin:Moore had been working through the concussion protocol, but the wideout is back in action and could potentially see some snaps in Saturday's preseason opener against the Packers. As the roster currently stands, Moore, Cedric Tillman, David Bell and Jamari Thrash are competing for snaps and targets behind Amari Cooper and Jerry Jeudy. ", " Desmond Ridder CardinalsQB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 2:07 PM Ridder looks set to start Saturday's exhibition opener against the Saints, and potentially Arizona's following two preseason contests, after coach Jonathan Gannon said Tuesday that Kyler Murray will not play until Week 1, Josh Weinfuss of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Ridder, who was dealt to the Cardinals back in March, appears primed for a busy preseason along with No. 3 quarterback Clayton Tune. After appearing in 19 regular-season games for the Falcons over the last two years, Ridder brings some NFL experience to the table as Murray's top backup, but he won't see much of the field this season if all goes well for Arizona. ", " Travis Homer BearsRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 1:14 PM With the Bears having D'Andre Swift, Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson on the roster, Homer will likely continue to see most of his snaps on special teams. Spin:Last year, Homer played six offensive snaps, but none of those were after Week 8. However, the veteran played at least 11 snaps on special teams in 15 of 16 games. Homer is in the last year of a contract he signed in 2023 and he should remain a core special-teamer. ", " Cairo Santos BearsK News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 1:02 PM Santos has three years remaining on his contract with Chicago, and he is currently the only kicker on the team's roster. Spin:In four years with the Bears, Santos has converted 93 percent of his field goals, making him one of the most accurate kickers in the league. However, due to being a part of some weak offenses, the kicker has exceeded 30 made field goals once since 2020. If the Bears offense breaks out with Caleb Williams at quarterback, Santos could become a top-12 option at his position. ", " Russell Gage RavensWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 10:43 AM The Ravens signed Gage on Tuesday. Spin:Gage missed the entire 2023 season after suffering a torn patellar tendon last August, but he's progressed to the point where the Ravens will give him a chance to compete for a WR spot behind top options Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman. The 28-year-old last saw regular-season action with Tampa Bay in 2022, when he recorded a 51/426/5 receiving line in 13 regular-season games. ", " Ronnie Rivers RamsRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 10:12 AM Rivers \"seemingly has the best chance to be the No. 3 running back\" for the Rams, according to Cameron DaSilva of Rams Wire. Spin:Rivers was the No. 2 back at times last season but now figures to fall behind rookie third-round pick Blake Corum, who reportedly has been impressive at training camp. With Corum profiling as Kyren Williams' backup, Rivers and Boston Scott are the favorites for back-end roster spots, which might mean more playing time on special teams than offense. ", " Hunter Luepke CowboysRB News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 7:55 AM Luepke has been used more often as a tight end or H-back so far in training camp, Nick Harris of DallasCowboys.com reports. Spin:An undrafted rookie out of North Dakota State last season, Luepke surprisingly won a spot on the 53-man roster and played in all 17 regular-season games plus the Cowboys' wild-card loss to the Packers, but he saw most of his action on special teams rather than at fullback. With the Dallas backfield likely to be a committee in 2024, Luepke could find more snaps as a lead blocker, pass catcher and occasional short-yardage option, but he's still unlikely to provide much fantasy production. ", " Xavier Gipson JetsWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 7:53 AM Gipson (leg) returned to practice Tuesday, Andy Vasquez of The Bergen Record reports. Spin:Gipson had been sidelined since the late July with an undisclosed leg injury, making his return a notable development for the Jets' offense. In addition to profiling as New York's top return man, especially since the surprise retirement of Tarik Cohen, Gipson figures to rotate alongside Allen Lazard and Malachi Corley in the No. 3 wide receiver role behind Garrett Wilson and Mike Williams (knee), the latter of whom remains on the active/PUP list. ", " Jalen Tolbert CowboysWR News Archive \t TUE, AUG 6, 7:42 AM Tolbert has been one of the most impressive players so far in the Cowboys' training camp, Nick Harris of the team's website reports. Spin:With CeeDee Lamb holding out while seeking a contract extension, Tolbert has used the available first-team reps to solidify his hold on the WR3 job. The third-year player out of South Alabama was the wideout who worked with Dak Prescott the most this offseason, and the duo is flashing much-improved chemistry in camp. If Lamb's holdout extends into the regular season, or he has a slow start due to the time he missed, Tolbert seems positioned to burst out of the gates on the 2024 campaign. August 5 Matt Breida 49ersRB News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 6:31 PM Brieda has agreed to a deal with the 49ers, Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Breida spent his first three seasons in San Francisco before stints with Miami, Buffalo and the Giants. His most productive years were those he spent with the 49ers, and he will now look for another opportunity to showcase his talents in the Bay Area. Isaac Guerendo (hamstring) was selected by the team in the fourth round of this year's draft and was expected to back up Christian McCaffrey and Elijah Mitchell in the backfield, but he is now expected to be sidelined for multiple weeks. As a result, Breida will compete with the likes of Jordan Mason, Patrick Taylor and Cody Schrader for a depth running back role heading into the season. ", " Jalen Guyton RaidersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 3:09 PM The Raiders activated Guyton (undisclosed) off their active/PUP list Monday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Guyton had been dealing with an undisclosed injury that forced him to miss almost two weeks of Raiders practice, but it now appears as if he's moved past the issue. The North Texas product has struggled with injuries over the last two seasons, appearing in just 11 regular-season games with the Chargers. If Guyton is able to remain healthy, he's expected to serve as a solid deep threat in his first year with Las Vegas. ", " Jacob Eason FAQB News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 2:34 PM The Packers waived Eason on Monday. Spin:Eason was picked up by the Packers less than two weeks ago, but it now appears that the team has decided to part ways with the Washington product. With Eason off the roster, Green Bay's No. 2 quarterback spot is expected to be claimed by either Sean Clifford or Michael Pratt. ", " Jesper Horsted PanthersTE News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 2:06 PM The Panthers agreed to terms with Horsted on Monday, David Newton of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Horsted is joining a Panthers tight-end room that's currently depleted, as both Ian Thomas (calf) and Tommy Tremble (hamstring) are dealing with injuries. The Princeton product is likely an extra camp body to take some load off the recovering Thomas and Tremble, but if he impresses throughout the preseason, he could earn a depth spot on Carolina's 53-man roster. ", " Harrison Butker ChiefsK News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 12:54 PM Butker has agreed to a four-year extension with the Chiefs, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports. Spin:Per Rapoport, Butker's deal -- which makes him the NFL's highest-paid kicker -- is a four-year, $25.6 million extension with $17.8 million in guarantees. The 29-year-old is coming off a 2023 regular season in which he made 33 of his 35 field-goal attempts en route to scoring 137 points in 17 games. While working behind Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes' helmed offense, Butker remains a premium fantasy kicking option ahead of the coming campaign. ", " Jerick McKinnon FARB News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 12:13 PM As the first full week of the NFL preseason approaches, McKinnon remains unsigned. Spin:In 12 regular-season games with the Chiefs last season, McKinnon carried 21 times for 60 yards and a TD, to go along with 25 catches (on 32 targets) for 192 yards and four receiving scores. For now, the 32-year-old remains without a team, which also applies to the likes of Kareem Hunt, Dalvin Cook and Latavius Murray. Once injuries hit NFL backfields as the preseason rolls along, however, the veteran free agents could draw some interest, with McKinnon offering a potential depth option for squads looking to add change-of-pace depth. ", " Trenton Irwin BengalsWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 10:49 AM Irwin is competing with Andrei Iosivas and Charlie Jones for the No. 3 receiver spot as the Bengals' preseason opener approaches, Geoff Hobson of the team's official site reports. Spin:While Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are entrenched as the Bengals' top two wideouts, Hobson suggests that the team could employ a committee approach behind the top duo. In addition to Irwin, Iosivas and Jones, 2024 third-rounder Jermaine Burton also should have a chance to enter the WR3 equation. On the team's initial posted unofficial depth chart, Irwin is listed behind Chase and Higgins, but that's presumably attributable to his status as a veteran. In any case, based on perceived upside and ADP, Burton and Iosivas appear to be next up on the radar of fantasy drafters in terms of Cincinnati wide receivers. ", " Van Jefferson SteelersWR News Archive \t MON, AUG 5, 7:37 AM Jefferson has taken most of the first-team reps in two-wide formations during training camp, Mike DeFabo of The Athletic reports. Spin:Jefferson was billed as the favorite for the No. 2 WR job heading into camp, albeit with competition for roles appearing wide open beyond runaway No. 1 receiver George Pickens. Rookie third-round pick Roman Wilson is considered week-to-week after injuring his ankle July 30, and third-year pro Calvin Austin seems like a better bet for the No. 3 role given that he's one of the smallest players in the league (listed at 5-foot-9, 162 pounds). Jefferson thus has a nice opportunity to earn a starting job, although that might entail a lot more blocking than catching passes under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Jefferson's 345 snaps under Smith in Atlanta last season yielded only 28 targets and a 12-101-0 line. August 4 Jacob Hollister PanthersTE News Archive \t SUN, AUG 4, 2:33 PM Hollister and the Panthers agreed on a contract Sunday, David Newton of ESPN.com reports. Spin:Hollister sat out the entire 2023 season after reaching an injury settlement with the Raiders last August, but he appears to be fully healthy ahead of the 2024 campaign. With Ian Thomas (calf) sidelined for the time being and Stephen Sullivan (quadriceps) out for the season, Hollister will provide Carolina with another depth option behind Tommy Tremble (hamstring) at tight end. August 3 Chris Myarick JaguarsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 3, 2:51 PM The Jaguars signed Myarick to a contract Saturday. Spin:Myarick sustained a metacarpal fracture in his hand near the end of training camp in 2023, and he was waived from the Giants' injured reserve in November. He played in 16 regular-season games with the Giants in 2022, recording seven catches for 65 yards and one touchdown. Now healthy, Myarick will compete for a depth spot at tight end in Jacksonville behind Evan Engram. ", " Gary Brightwell JaguarsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 3, 2:46 PM The Jaguars signed Brightwell to a contract Saturday. Spin:Brightwell appeared in seven regular-season games with the Giants in 2023, registering 66 yards from scrimmage on 14 touches while playing 39 snaps on offense and 99 on special teams. He sustained a hamstring injury in Week 7 against the Commanders and ended the season on IR. He reached an injury settlement with the Giants in June, and he'll now compete for a depth running back spot on the Jaguars behind Travis Etienne and Tank Bigsby. ", " Ian Thomas PanthersTE Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 3, 12:03 PM Thomas (calf) has suffered a calf injury but is hopeful to be ready for Week 1, Joe Person of The Athletic reports. Spin:Thomas is currently projected as the third tight end on Carolina's roster behind Tommy Tremble and Ja'Tavion Sanders. Thus, a return to training camp prior to Week 1 would be beneficial for the veteran tight end's aim toward securing a spot on the team's 53-man roster. Still, the 28-year-old has been with the team since 2018 and figures to be more likely than not to make the squad. Thus, expect Carolina to err on the side of caution in regard to bringing him back to practice too early. ", " Jonathon Brooks PanthersRB Out News Archive \t SAT, AUG 3, 10:08 AM Panthers coach Dave Canales said Saturday that Brooks (knee) won't play in the preseason and isn't expected to make his NFL debut until Week 3 or Week 4 of the regular season, Joe Person of The Athletic reports. Spin:Brooks is still rehabbing the torn ACL he suffered last November, though the injury didn't stop the Panthers from picking him in the second round of April's NFL Draft. There was initially some optimism that the running back could be ready to practice at the start of training camp, but it's now apparent that he will be eased along cautiously and won't suit up for any preseason contests. It's possible that Brooks will begin the campaign on the PUP list, in which case he wouldn't be eligible to play until Week 5. With Brooks set to miss at least the first three games of the regular season, Chuba Hubbard's hold on the lead back role entering Week 1 may be cemented, though it's still possible that Miles Sanders gives him competition for those duties. August 2 Kevin Rader SaintsTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 2, 6:27 PM The Saints are set to sign Rader, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:Rader played in 14 regular-season games with Tennessee last season, logging one catch on three targets for six yards over 140 offensive snaps. The tight end out of Youngstown State also logged 219 snaps on special teams. Rader will compete for a depth role with the Saints among a tight-end group that is headed by Juwan Johnson (foot), Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau. New Orleans also signed Mason Fairchild -- another tight end -- Friday. ", " Justice Hill RavensRB News Archive \t FRI, AUG 2, 1:21 PM Coach John Harbaugh noted Thursday that Hill will maintain a valuable role in the backfield rotation behind Derrick Henry, Clifton Brown of the Ravens' official site reports. \"He is a high caliber running back. So, to have him along Derrick, along with the young guys, it's really great. He's going to give us a little different style than Derrick Henry,\" Harbaugh noted of Hill, adding \"I think he's going to play a lot and kind of do it his way.\" Spin:Though Henry profiles as the team's clear lead back, with Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins no longer in the mix and Keaton Mitchell still recovering from a knee injury, Hill is poised to have a key complementary role in Baltimore's backfield out of the gate in 2024. Also competing for depth touches behind Henry are fifth-round rookie Rasheen Ali and Owen Wright. In 16 regular-season contests last season, Hill carried 84 times for 387 yards and three TDs, while adding 28 catches (on 39 targets) for 206 yards and a receiving score. ", " Hunter Kampmoyer BroncosTE News Archive \t FRI, AUG 2, 12:28 PM The Broncos signed Kampmoyer on Friday. Spin:Kampmoyer has only ever been with the Chargers in his NFL career, competing mostly on the team's practice squad for much of the last three seasons. The 6-foot-4 tight end has appeared in two career regular-season games but has yet to record a catch. Joining the Broncos could be a necessary change of scenery as the 26-year-old will fight for likely a reserve blocking role ahead of the 2024 campaign. August 1 Brett Rypien BearsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 1, 9:57 PM Rypien completed 11 of 15 passes for 166 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Bears' 21-17 preseason win over the Texans on Thursday. He added one rush for nine yards. Spin:Rypien took over on the Bears' second possession and was masterful during his time in the game, averaging 11.1 yards per attempt while connecting with Collin Johnson (20, nine yards) and Tommy Sweeney (22 yards) for his trio of touchdown tosses. The journeyman signal-caller joined Chicago when free agency opened, and although he's generally been perceived as the No. 3 quarterback, Thursday's showing suggests he could conceivably usurp Tyson Bagent for the No. 2 job if he can put together an impressive enough body of work this preseason. ", " Tyson Bagent BearsQB News Archive \t THU, AUG 1, 9:52 PM Bagent started the Bears' 21-17 preseason win over the Texans on Thursday, completing two of three passes for 16 yards. Spin:As his modest final line implies, Bagent, who's thought to have the inside track to the No. 2 job, made only a cameo appearance. The second-year pro played on the Bears' first possession and recorded his two completions to Roschon Johnson and Stephen Carlson. Brett Rypien, Bagent's competition to serve as the primary backup to first overall pick Caleb Williams, saw the bulk of playing time in the weather-shortened game and excelled in a three-touchdown performance, so Bagent will likely have to perform well in any more extensive action he may see the remainder of preseason to ensure he keeps his presumptive lead in the job battle. ", " Collin Johnson BearsWR News Archive \t THU, AUG 1, 9:25 PM Johnson brought in three of six targets for 56 yards and two touchdowns in the Bears' 21-17 preseason win over the Texans on Thursday. Spin:Johnson co-led the Bears in receptions and set the pace in both receiving yards and targets for the team on the night, recording 20- and nine-yard touchdown grabs from Brett Rypien in the second and third quarter, respectively, before the game was called early due to weather. Johnson's first score atoned for a drop on a catchable pass from Rypien earlier in the drive, and the 2020 fifth-round pick of the Jaguars ended up making a solid opening case for a reserve receiver role. Johnson is likely to receive ample opportunity to prove himself over the final three preseason contests, and his experience and downfield prowess should give him a good chance in a job battle with the likes of Velus Jones, DeAndre Carter and Dante Pettis. ", " Roschon Johnson BearsRB News Archive \t THU, AUG 1, 8:54 PM Johnson rushed six times for 24 yards and brought in his only target for seven yards in the Bears' 21-17 preseason win over the Texans on Thursday. Spin:With offseason addition D'Andre Swift sitting out the preseason opener, Johnson got the call as the Bears' starting running back and gained 17 yards on four carries during Chicago's opening possession. The second-year pro went on to record his final seven rushing yards on the Bears' third and fourth drives after ceding the second possession to Khalil Herbert, who Johnson is battling for the No. 2 running back job. Considering the team invested a fourth-round pick in Johnson last year and he flashed upside as both runner and receiver as a rookie, he could have the inside track in the competition, although the remainder of training camp and preseason will serve as the platform for each back to make a case. July 31 Irv Smith Jr. ChiefsTE News Archive \t WED, JUL 31, 2:36 PM Smith has worked with Kansas City's first-team offense during camp and has been a pleasant surprise for the coaching staff, Pete Sweeney of ArrowheadPride.com reports. Spin:Smith disappointed in 2023, as he wasn't able to take hold of the top spot on Cincinnati's depth chart at tight end and finished with just 18 catches for 115 yards and one touchdown across 12 games. He seems to be making a good first impression in Kansas City, as he's proving to be a reliable target in practices on the occasions he's filled in for Travis Kelce on the first-team offense. He's got a real chance to make the Chiefs' 53-man roster and is likely competing with Noah Gray and Jared Wiley for a depth role in the team's tight end room. ", " Byron Pringle CommandersWR News Archive \t WED, JUL 31, 1:49 PM The Commanders signed Pringle on Wednesday. Spin:Pringle has rejoined the Commanders after playing with Washington during the 2023 season. The veteran wideout tallied 14 receptions for 161 yards and no touchdowns across 17 games last year, and he's expected to compete for another depth role in the Commanders' WR room as the preseason progresses. ", " Romeo Doubs PackersWR News Archive \t WED, JUL 31, 11:35 AM Packers offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich said Monday that Doubs has \"super strong hands\" and is \"pretty tremendous\" at running routes, Zach Kruse of USA Today reports. Spin:Doubs hype is reaching a crescendo in the second week of training camp, with a slew of Packers beat writers reporting that the wideout has been one of the team's standout performers. Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander poured fuel on the fire Tuesday when he said Doubs is his second-favorite receiver in the league (after former teammate Davante Adams) and acknowledged that the 24-year-old often wins their one-on-one battles in practice, per Paul Bretl of 105.5 ESPN La Crosse. Quarterback Jordan Love has also expressed confidence this summer in Doubs, who had 234 yards in two playoff games this past January after finishing the regular season with 674 receiving yards. The enthusiasm is encouraging, but Doubs will still face stout target and snap competition from fellow young wideouts Jayden Reed, Christian Watson and Dontayvion Wicks. July 30 Anthony Firkser JetsTE News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 4:43 PM Links up with Gang Green Spin:After being let go by the Patriots during training camp last August, Firsker caught on with the Lions' practice squad in October. He appeared in the Lions' final five games of the season, including their three playoff games after Sam LaPorta injured his knee in Week 18. Firkser's ability to play both tight end and fullback could give him a leg up on tight ends Kenny Yeboah and Zack Kuntz to make the 53-man roster. ", " Josh Ali FalconsWR News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 4:31 PM Back at practice Spin:Ali missed the entire 2023 season due to an ankle injury, but he appears to be fully healthy. He was able to make the Falcons' 53-man roster last year, and he'll look to do so again as a depth wide receiver. ", " Matt Sokol SteelersTE News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 3:39 PM Headed to Pittsburgh Spin:The move corresponds with Pittsburgh cutting wide receiver Marquez Callaway. Sokol was a member of the Patriots' practice squad in 2023 and appeared in the final three games of the regular season, playing 14 snaps on offense and six snaps on special teams. Sokol will look to crack the Steelers' 53-man roster as a depth tight end behind Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington. ", " Miles Sanders PanthersRB News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 1:59 PM Getting first-team work Spin:Sanders became a forgotten man in fantasy circles following a disastrous first year in Carolina, with his value taking yet another hit in April when the Panthers drafted Jonathon Brooks (knee) 46th overall. Kaye refers to Hubbard as \"the leader in the clubhouse\" for the starting job but also notes that there's \"legitimate competition\" for backfield roles. Brooks is still on the non-football injury list after an ACL tear brought his college career to an early conclusion, while Sanders is back at full strength after a heel injury limited him during June minicamp. As bad as Sanders was last season, the Panthers have incentive to give him a second chance in light of his 2024 base salary ($4.02 million) being fully guaranteed. There's no major financial incentive to part ways with Sanders before next offseason, so a new coaching staff and front office in Carolina will at least give him a fair shake rather than handing things over to Hubbard (and eventually Brooks) without a challenge. ", " Tyler Allgeier FalconsRB News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 9:02 AM Ticketed for big role again Spin:It's not what Bijan Robinson drafters want to hear, following a rookie season in which the 2023 eighth overall pick got only 28 more carries (214 to 186) than his backfield mate. Allgeier wasn't as efficient as he had been during his own rookie season the year prior, dropping from 4.9 yards per carry in 2022 to 3.7 YPC in 2023, but it sounds like the new coaching staff in Atlanta nonetheless views him as a big part of their plan on offense. While the workload figures to shift more in Robinson's favor this year, it might not be quite to the extent people are hoping for when they use a first-round fantasy pick on the 22-year-old. ", " Jake Bobo SeahawksWR News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 8:07 AM Looking good for No. 4 WR spot Spin:Bobo made the team as an undrafted rookie last year, shining in the preseason and then getting playing time off the bench throughout the regular season. He drew targets on just 25 of his 148 routes, 16.9 percent, but took advantage of the limited opportunities with 19 catches for 196 yards and two touchdowns. Bobo had 64.8 percent of his yardage in a three-game stretch Weeks 6-8, and the lack of production thereafter suggests he's probably headed for a depth role again, not to mention the difficulty of gaining ground on the trio of DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. ", " Rashaad Penny FARB News Archive \t TUE, JUL 30, 6:51 AM Placed on reserve/retired list Spin:There are always a few retirements this time of year, with players realizing they're unlikely to earn a roster spot and don't have much of a future in the league. Penny was a first-round pick for Seattle back in 2018 but played only 45 games over six NFL seasons amidst a slew of injuries. He had a memorable stretch at the end of the 2021 campaign, amassing 135 or more rushing yards four times over the final five weeks, but his 671 rushing yards during that stretch represent 34.4 percent of his career total. July 29 Cam Little JaguarsK News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 5:54 PM Lone kicker on roster Spin:Little is now the lone kicker on Jacksonville's roster after the team waived Riley Patterson on Monday. The two were competing for the team's kicking job and it looks like Little has come out on top. The rookie was selected in the sixth round of the NFL Draft this offseason at 212th overall. He never missed an extra-point attempt during his collegiate career at Arkansas, and he also converted four of five field-goal tries from 50 yards or more in 2023. Special-teams coordinator Heath Farwell indicated Saturday that Little has been locked in and consistent at camp. ", " Terrell Bynum RaidersWR News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 3:43 PM Inks deal with Las Vegas Spin:The Cowboys actually worked out Bynum just two days prior, but it appears the USC product went in a different direction and signed with the Raiders. Bynum, an undrafted second-year wide receiver, appeared in one game with the Chargers last season, failing to record a stat. He'll likely be competing for a depth spot in Las Vegas' wide receiver room as the training camp progresses. ", " Avery Williams FalconsRB News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 1:25 PM First-team returner Spin:Given the new return rules in the NFL, teams are trying different personnel combinations to start training camp. Surprisingly, phenom running back Bijan Robinson isn't getting any looks as a return man to start training camp, with Williams and McCloud currently backed up by Mike Hughes and Rondale Moore. Williams has totaled 803 kick-return yards and 445 punt-return yards over his first two seasons in Atlanta. ", " Ray-Ray McCloud III FalconsWR News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 12:41 PM Getting regular first-team work Spin:Multiple Atlanta beat reporters have McCloud working ahead of Rondale Moore, not only during training camp but dating back to spring practices. It sounds like McCloud has even seen a good number of targets from Kirk Cousins, including passes deep downfield. That's somewhat surprising given that McCloud played for four different teams over the past six seasons and amassed more punt returns (138) and kickoff returns (108) than receptions (90). He did have a couple stints as a No. 3 receiver, including most of the 2021 season in Pittsburgh and a chunk of 2022 for the 49ers. There's a good chance McCloud factors in on punt/kick returns even if he's a significant part of Atlanta's offense. ", " Tutu Atwell RamsWR News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 12:33 PM Getting chance at No. 3 job Spin:Atwell lost said role to Robinson down the stretch last season, despite starting the year strong while Cooper Kupp was sidelined by a hamstring injury. Atwell had 246 receiving yards Weeks 1-3, and then just 237 yards over 13 subsequent regular-season appearances (though he did score a 38-yard TD on his lone target in a playoff loss to Detroit). The 2021 second-round pick now seems likely to land in a depth role for the final year of his rookie contract, with some risk of falling behind not only Robinson but also sixth-round pick Jordan Whittington. ", " Will Reichard VikingsK News Archive \t MON, JUL 29, 11:57 AM Wins kicking competition Spin:It appears that Reichard has won the job for Minnesota's kicking duties in 2024, which is no surprise considering the Alabama product was the first kicker selected in this year's NFL Draft. Reichard now stands alone as the only kicker on the Vikings' roster. July 28 Ryan Flournoy CowboysWR News Archive \t SUN, JUL 28, 11:16 AM Dealing with knee issue Spin:McCarthy added that Flournoy's issue isn't \"classified as anything serious,\" according to Nicole Hutchison of the Cowboys' official site. The 6-foot-1 wide receiver out of Southeast Missouri State was selected in the sixth round after a dazzling performance as the 2024 NFL Combine, and he'll likely compete for one of the final spots in Dallas' receiver room this training camp. Top wideout CeeDee Lamb also is holding out of training camp while awaiting a contract extension, so Flournoy's absence should open up some valuable opportunities for other fringe roster players like Racey McMath and Jalen Moreno-Cropper. July 27 Michael Badgley LionsK Injured Reserve News Archive \t SAT, JUL 27, 1:44 PM Moves to IR Spin:Badgley tore his hamstring during practice Thursday and will be out for the entire 2024 campaign. The veteran was slated to compete for the opportunity to be Detroit's kicker for the upcoming campaign, so the team will likely bring another kicker into training camp to push Jake Bates for the role. Bates was signed by the Lions in June after a record-setting performance in the UFL this spring, but he's yet to take a snap in the NFL. ", " Ryan Tannehill FAQB News Archive \t SAT, JUL 27, 9:34 AM Still waiting out options Spin:Given Tannehill's 11 years of starting experience and the NFL's near maniac rush to get quality quarterbacks -- even highly paid backups -- on the roster over the past few years, it's surprising that the veteran hasn't yet found a new home. It seems clear that the 36-year-old is holding out for hope at competing for a starting job, but at this point in the offseason it remains to be seen if any such opportunity will arise. Tannehill lost his starting job midway through the 2023 campaign to Will Levis as the Titans opted for a younger signal caller amidst a woeful 6-11 season, but Tannehill did return for the team's final three games with Levis injured, failing to throw for over 170 yards in any of the aforementioned games. July 26 Feleipe Franks PanthersTE News Archive \t FRI, JUL 26, 4:09 PM Signed by Carolina Spin:Franks had a tryout with Carolina on Monday, and he impressed the organization enough to get a contract. The 26-year-old spent the previous three seasons with Atlanta, though he was on injured reserve all of last year due to an undisclosed issue. Franks is presumably now healthy, and he'll look to make a positive impression in training camp with the aim of competing for a roster spot. ", " Davion Davis CommandersWR News Archive \t FRI, JUL 26, 8:58 AM Surprise standout early in camp Spin:Davis went undrafted back in 2019 and is now 27 years old with four regular-season NFL appearances to his name (none since 2021), but it sounds like he's making a real bid for a roster spot on a team that lacks sure things at wide receiver beyond runaway No. 1 Terry McLaurin. Davis spent time on three different NFL practice squads last year after finishing second in the USFL with 575 receiving yards during the league's 2023 season. July 25 Zonovan Knight LionsRB News Archive \t THU, JUL 25, 2:43 PM Healthy to start camp Spin:Knight suffered a torn labrum last season and spent the final three months on injured reserve. He's competing for a roster spot behind David Montgomery, Jahmyr Gibbs and Craig Reynolds this summer. ", " Jordan Travis JetsQB Out News Archive", "View:AllInjury News Only Sort By:DateTeam August 24 Malachi Corley JetsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:38 PM Corley recorded one catch on three targets for five yards in Saturday's 10-6 preseason win over the Giants. Spin:Corley played for the entire first half and appeared regularly in 11 personnel. His play remained inconsistent, as he was called for a holding penalty on the team's first drive and also had a reception reversed for failing to complete the process of the catch. Given his status as a third-round pick, Corley's roster spot should be safe. However, his ability to contribute immediately offensively is far less clear. ", " Bucky Irving BuccaneersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:28 PM Irving rushed six times for 26 yards and brought in his only target for five yards in the Buccaneers' 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins on Friday night. Spin:The rookie had drawn the start in the first two preseason games, but Rachaad White saw his first and only action of the exhibition slate Friday and was the first running back in. Irving checked in on the second possession and put together another solid performance relative to opportunity, and he appears set to start the regular season as the clear-cut No. 2 back behind White. ", " Israel Abanikanda JetsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:28 PM Abanikanda rushed the ball nine times for 83 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 10-6 preseason win over the Giants. He added one reception on one target for six yards. Spin:Abanikanda served as the starting running back with Breece Hall, Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis all sitting out. That Abanikanda suited up indicates his spot on the running back depth chart, though he did make the play of the game when he ran through several attempted tackles for a 45-yard touchdown early in the second quarter. He'll enter cutdown day on the roster bubble, but even if he doesn't stick with the Jets, he should be able to find opportunity elsewhere around the league. ", " Kyle Trask BuccaneersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:24 PM Trask completed 17 of 24 passes for 141 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions while adding one carry for one yard in the Buccaneers' 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins on Friday night. Spin:Baker Mayfield started and led the Buccaneers on a touchdown drive during the opening possession, and Trask subsequently took over for the duration of the contest. As his final implies, the third-year signal-caller was sharp and mistake-free throughout, and he connected with Ryan Miller (10 yards) and Tanner Knue (two yards) for his pair of scoring tosses. With John Wolford not seeing any action Friday and Trask looking impressive with his extended opportunity, it appears likely the latter has locked up the No. 2 quarterback job. ", " Garrett Wilson JetsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:21 PM Wilson did not play in Saturday's 10-6 preseason win over the Giants. Spin:Along with other key starters for the Jets, Wilson did not suit up at all during the exhibition season. Through two seasons as a pro, Wilson has shown an elite ability to draw targets, but quarterback play has held back his production. That shouldn't be an issue in 2024 assuming Aaron Rodgers can stay healthy, as Wilson will once again operate as the Jets' clear top pass-catching option. ", " Sean Tucker BuccaneersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:20 PM Tucker rushed seven times for 20 yards and brought in his only target for a 27-yard gain in the Buccaneers' 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins on Friday night. Spin:Tucker led the Buccaneers in carries on the night while checking in second to Bucky Irving in rushing yardage, while also making a splash play on his one reception. Tucker didn't enter the game until the final possession of the first half, but he's shown well overall this preseason and should be a relative certainty for a roster spot with Chase Edmonds (undisclosed) seemingly headed to injured reserve to open the campaign. ", " Cody Thompson BuccaneersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 9:16 PM Thompson secured seven of eight targets for 45 yards in the Buccaneers' 24-14 preseason win over the Dolphins on Friday night. Spin:Thompson led the Buccaneers in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, putting together a fitting cap on what has been a very productive training camp and preseason. The journeyman wideout may have done enough to carve out a spot at the bottom of the team's receiver depth chart after recording 15 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown through three exhibitions, and Rakim Jarrett's (undisclosed) likely placement on IR could clear the path for Thompson to make it past final cutdowns. ", " Isaiah McKenzie GiantsWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:32 PM McKenzie suffered a right foot injury and also had a laceration on his knee following Saturday's 10-6 preseason loss to the Jets, Art Stapleton of The Bergen Record reports. Spin:McKenzie recorded two receptions on two targets for 15 yards and was also the team's primary punt returner. The latter role is his potential path to a roster spot as McKenzie tallied 204 punt return yards and 152 kick return yards in 2023. He's on the roster bubble and will now be set for an MRI in the coming days, another factor that could affect his status with the Giants. ", " Allen Robinson II GiantsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:27 PM Robinson recorded one reception on one target for four yards in Saturday's preseason 10-6 loss to the Jets. Spin:Robinson's stat line doesn't have much meaning, but the fact that he suited up was not a positive sign of his status on the Giants' roster. The team sat their top four receivers -- all of whom are certain to make the roster -- leaving Robinson and Isiah Hodgins to start the game. However, with special teams contributors such as Miles Boykin and Isaiah McKenzie (knee/foot) also vying for roster spots, Robinson could be on the wrong side of the bubble. ", " Isaiah Hodgins GiantsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:19 PM Hodgins recorded one reception on two targets for three yards in Saturday's 10-6 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:The Giants rested all four of their top wide receivers, leaving Hodgins and Allen Robinson on the field to begin the game. Tommy DeVito struggled to move the ball through the air, making it difficult to evaluate Hodgins' performance. However, his status on the roster is certainly in question given that he appeared in this game, and the Giants could opt to keep other players at the position ahead of Hodgins given his lack of ability to contribute on special teams. ", " Tommy DeVito GiantsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:11 PM DeVito completed 14 of 27 passes for 103 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Saturday's 10-6 preseason loss to the Jets. He added five rushes for 48 yards. Spin:The Giants opted not to play Daniel Jones or Drew Lock (hip), leaving DeVito to play the entire contest. He turned in an uneven performance, as he was sacked eight times and averaged an abysmal 3.8 yards per attempt. However, DeVito showed some resiliency and managed to move the ball with short passes and scrambles to lead two scoring drives. He'll enter the season as nothing better than the third quarterback on the depth chart, though it's unclear if he'll survive cutdown day on the roster. ", " Drew Lock GiantsQB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 8:01 PM Lock (hip) did not appear in Saturday's 10-6 preseason loss to the Jets. Spin:Lock injured his hip in the Giants' first preseason contest and has not appeared in game action since. However, he has returned to team drills and was spotted in pads before Saturday's game. Considering the health concerns surrounding starter Daniel Jones, the Giants had little to gain by putting Lock in potential jeopardy ahead of the regular season. Lock will enter the season as the backup. ", " D'Onta Foreman BrownsRB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:56 PM Foreman sustained a rib injury during Saturday's preseason contest in Seattle, Kelsey Russo of the Browns' official site reports. Spin:After a three-yard carry on the first play of the second quarter, Foreman needed assistance to make his way to the sideline tent and then walked slowly to the locker room, at which point the health concern became clear. The Browns are banged-up at running back at the moment, with all of Nick Chubb (knee, PUP), Pierre Strong (rib) and Nyheim Hines (knee, NFI) not practicing at the moment. Considering it's exhibition season, the team likely will exercise caution with Foreman, instead rolling with Aidan Robbins and Jacob Saylors for the rest of Saturday's game. ", " Samori Toure PackersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:53 PM Toure corralled two of four targets for 28 yards in Saturday's preseason tilt against the Ravens. Spin:Toure got consistent work this preseason in absence of Green Bay's regular starters, finishing with five receptions for 53 yards and one carry for as many yards. The third-year receiver remains in the mix for one of the Packers' final roster spots as Week 1 approaches. ", " Malik Heath PackersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:44 PM Heath caught four of five targets for 39 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's preseason finale versus the Ravens. Spin:Heath was one of several young wideouts to get promoted to the starting lineup in place of resting starters in Saturday's conclusion to exhibition play. The 24-year-old put a bow on a solid preseason as the team's leading receiver, giving him a legitimate shot to make Green Bay's roster or practice squad ahead of the regular season kicking off. ", " Bo Melton PackersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:39 PM Melton had one reception on two targets for 18 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's preseason finale against the Ravens. Spin:Melton cashed in one of Green Bay's two passing touchdowns in a 30-7 exhibition win. The 25-year-old had one receiving touchdown across five games played last season. Melton could find himself in a similar role as a reserve wideout this upcoming season, which is to say he shouldn't warrant much fantasy consideration in standard drafts. ", " Emanuel Wilson PackersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 7:03 PM Wilson took 11 carries for 52 yards and caught both of his targets for 26 yards in Saturday's preseason finale. Spin:Wilson started the Packers' final exhibition with Josh Jacobs (coach's decision) and AJ Dillon (neck) sitting out the win over Baltimore. With the start of the season right around the corner, Wilson appears to not only have inside track to a spot on the final roster, but he could find himself in the No. 2 role should Dillon's neck injury cost him any time once the games begin to count. Managers in deep leagues should take note of Wilson and the backup situation in Green Bay. ", " Charlie Kolar RavensTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:51 PM Kolar had two receptions on three targets for 14 yards in Saturday's preseason tilt against the Packers. Spin:Kolar got some run with Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely sitting out Baltimore's exhibition finale. The 25-year-old doesn't project to be a fantasy factor this season with the kind of receiving talent ahead of him on the Ravens' tight end depth chart. ", " Devontez Walker RavensWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:46 PM Walker (ribs) had one reception for five yards on two targets in Saturday's preseason finale. Spin:Walker returned from a minor rib injury that nagged the rookie wideout this preseason. The fourth-round pick out of North Carolina remains in pole position to nab one of the backup spots behind Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and Nelson Agholor come Week 1. Walker will struggle to put up consistent fantasy numbers in that role out of the gates, but he has the size (6-foot-1, 191 pounds) and to go with a 4.36 40-yard time to be worth noting should playing time open up in the future. ", " Peyton Hendershot CowboysTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:42 PM Hendershot caught his only target for a 10-yard gain in Saturday's 26-19 preseason loss to the Chargers. Spin:The third-year tight end has been dealing with a shoulder injury for most of training camp, but Hendershot was able to play in the Cowboys' preseason finale and haul in his lone pass late in the first quarter. With Jake Ferguson and 2023 second-round pick Luke Schoonmaker locked in atop the tight end depth chart, Hendershot is in a fierce battle with John Stephens, Brevyn Spann-Ford and others for one of the team's final roster spots. ", " Tylan Wallace RavensWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:39 PM Wallace took his only reception 48 yards for a touchdown in Saturday's preseason finale against the Packers. Spin:Wallace has been vying for one of the Ravens' final receiver/special teams slots this upcoming season. The Oklahoma State product put an exclamation point on his pitch for the job by scoring his team's only touchdown on his only reception in Saturday's exhibition. Wallace and the rest of Baltimore's roster hopefuls will find out their 2024 fates Tuesday. ", " Royce Freeman CowboysRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:38 PM Freeman carried the ball eight times for 35 yards and caught his only target for seven yards in Saturday's 26-19 preseason loss to the Chargers. Spin:With Ezekiel Elliott and Rico Dowdle sitting out Dallas' preseason finale, Malik Davis and Deuce Vaughn both saw carries before Freeman did and posted better yards per carry averages on the day, which bodes poorly for the veteran's chances of being on the roster for Week 1. Freeman has been barely hanging on in the NFL for a few years now, and his 77 carries for the Rams in 2023 was his highest total since 2019. While he still appears capable of handling a depth role in a backfield, the Cowboys may elect to go with their younger homegrown options instead. ", " Malik Davis CowboysRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:33 PM Davis carried the ball five times for 28 yards and caught his only target for minus-2 yards in Saturday's 26-19 preseason loss to the Chargers. He also returned one kickoff for 25 yards. Spin:Davis got the start once again in the backfield with Rico Dowdle and Ezekiel Elliott sitting out, but he quickly yielded snaps to Deuce Vaughn and eventually Royce Freeman. Which of those backs will claim depth roles on the RB depth chart remains unclear, but Davis at least didn't seem to hurt his chances with a solid, if abbreviated, performance Saturday. ", " Deuce Vaughn CowboysRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:30 PM Vaughn carried the ball nine times for 53 yards and failed to catch two targets in Saturday's 26-19 preseason loss to the Chargers. He added 23 yards on one kickoff return. Spin:Vaughn mixed into the backfield on the Cowboys' first drive of the day, and the Kansas State product showed off his ability to produce chunk plays with an 18-yard scamper in the second quarter that set up Dallas' first touchdown of the day. Vaughn is fighting for a spot on the season-opening roster behind Ezekiel Elliott and Rico Dowdle in the backfield, and the fact that he got carries before Royce Freeman and out-produced the veteran can be taken as a positive sign for his chances. ", " Trey Lance CowboysQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:23 PM Lance completed 33 of 49 passes for 323 yards and a touchdown with five interceptions in Saturday's 26-19 preseason loss to the Chargers. He added a team-high 90 rushing yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. Spin:The 2021 third overall pick flashed both his elite athleticism and his shaky decision-making in the Cowboys' preseason finale. Lance hit Ryan Flournoy for an 11-yard TD inside the final two minutes of the first half, then added an electric 46-yard run to the end zone late in the third quarter. Lance also got picked off five times, with three of those INTs coming in the fourth quarter as Dallas attempted to mount a comeback, and one of those three turning into a pick-six that nearly put the game out of reach. Lance's performance all but confirmed that Cooper Rush will begin the season as the team's primary backup to Dak Prescott, but he's still expected to begin the year on the 53-man roster. ", " Simi Fehoko ChargersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:12 PM Fehoko caught both his targets for 85 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 26-19 preseason win over the Cowboys. Spin:Facing the team he made his NFL debut with in 2021, Fehoko got under a deep pass from Easton Stick on the first play of the second quarter, shed his defender and stayed in bounds before sprinting into the end zone. Fehoko is fighting for one of the last spots on an unsettled wide receiver depth chart following the offseason departures of Keenan Allen and Mike Williams (knee), but even Saturday's big play might not have been enough to claim a job on the season-opening roster. The Stanford product may have to settle for a spot on the Chargers' practice squad instead. ", " Hendon Hooker LionsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:09 PM Hooker completed 12 of 20 passes for 114 yards, one touchdown and one interception in Saturday's 24-17 preseason win over the Steelers. Spin:Hooker drew the start with neither Jared Goff nor Nate Sudfeld in action. He unsurprisingly struggled in the early series during which the Steelers' played some of their starters, but he did rebound to lead a 12-play, 72-yard touchdown drive just before halftime which concluded with a two-yard touchdown pass. Hooker looks to have the third quarterback position in his grasp heading into the regular season. ", " Derius Davis ChargersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:06 PM Davis had only one touch in Saturday's 26-19 preseason win over the Cowboys, taking an end-around 70 yards for a touchdown on the Chargers' first play from scrimmage. Spin:The 2023 fourth-round pick may have done all he needed to do to secure his spot on the 53-man roster with one carry, as Davis took the handoff from Easton Stick, beat a couple Dallas defenders to the corner and took off down the sideline. Davis figures to be the Chargers' primary kick returner this season, but with Keenan Allen and Mike Williams (knee) both now wearing other uniforms, the team's wide receiver corps has a lot of snaps and targets up for grabs. If players like Joshua Palmer, DJ Chark (hip) and Quentin Johnston don't step up, Davis could get some opportunities on offense as the season progresses. ", " John Metchie III TexansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 6:05 PM Metchie caught two of three targets for 21 yards in Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams. Spin:Metchie is looking to earn one of the backup spots behind the starting trio of Stefon Diggs, Nico Collins and Tank Dell this upcoming season. The 24-year-old was coming off of a strong showing in the Texans' second preseason tilt when he had six receptions for 68 yards and a score. Metchie figures to either make the squad or land on the team's practice squad following a strong exhibition campaign. ", " Amon-Ra St. Brown LionsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:59 PM St. Brown did not play in Saturday's 24-17 preseason win over the Steelers. Spin:The Lions didn't play the majority of their starters this preseason and St. Brown was among them. He'll now turn his focus to a Week 1 matchup against the Rams and should remain the top pass-catching option in the offense after topping 145 targets in each of the last two seasons. ", " David Njoku BrownsTE Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:53 PM Njoku (undisclosed) isn't slated to play in Saturday's preseason contest at Seattle, Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Spin:Njoku has been dealing with some soreness since mid-August, which has kept him off the practice field in the meantime. With his lack of availability for the exhibition finale confirmed, he'll set his sights on a Week 1 matchup with the Cowboys on Sunday, Sept. 8. Over the last two campaigns with the Browns, Njoku has come on as a receiving threat with a combined 139 catches (on 203 targets) for 1,510 yards and 10 touchdowns in 30 regular-season games. ", " Easton Stick ChargersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:50 PM Stick completed 12 of 29 passes for 187 yards, a touchdown and an interception in Saturday's 26-19 preseason win over the Cowboys. He added 17 rushing yards on four carries. Spin:It was a poor performance through the air for Stick, but he didn't need to do much with Trey Lance throwing five INTs for Dallas, and Derius Davis and Simi Fehoko scoring a couple long TDs in the first half. Stick appears to be locked into the No. 2 quarterback role, but Justin Herbert (foot) is on track to be ready for Week 1 and the Chargers will be hoping his backup isn't needed for extensive action again as he was late in 2023. ", " Jerry Jeudy BrownsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:47 PM Jeudy isn't slated to play in Saturday's preseason game in Seattle, Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Spin:On Wednesday, coach Kevin Stefanksi said certain Browns starters had a chance to play this weekend, but the team ultimately will keep QB Deshaun Watson, WR Amari Cooper and TE David Njoku (undisclosed) on the sideline along with Jeudy. As a result, Jeudy's debut with Cleveland will have to wait until Week 1 on Sunday, Sept. 8 against the Cowboys after four campaigns in Denver in which he topped out with a 67-972-6 receiving line in 15 regular-season games back in 2022. ", " Cam Akers TexansRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:39 PM Akers took seven carries for 53 yards and caught three of four targets for 19 yards in Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams. Spin:Akers was first player to record a touch in Saturday's exhibition, as the veteran tries to latch onto the Texans' 53-man roster ahead of the Sept. 27 deadline. The 2020 second-round pick was brought in for depth after starter Joe Mixon suffered an injury this preseason. The latter has since healed and was a healthy scratch Saturday, leaving any potential fantasy value for Akers in Houston in the rearview mirror. ", " Amari Cooper BrownsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:39 PM Cooper isn't in line to play in Saturday's preseason game at Seattle, Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Spin:Along with Cooper, QB Deshaun Watson, WR Jerry Jeudy and TE David Njoku (undisclosed) won't be available for the Browns' exhibition finale. Cooper thus will turn his focus to Week 1 and beyond, as he's coming off his first two campaigns with the Browns having averaged 75.3 receiving yards per game and totaled 14 TDs in 32 regular-season contests. ", " Ainias Smith EaglesWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:33 PM Smith caught six of nine targets for 36 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason loss to the Vikings. He also returned one punt for 14 yards. Spin:The 2024 fifth-round pick led the Eagles in catches and targets Saturday as he made his final case for a home on the season-opening roster. Smith's narrow path to a significant role in the slot likely closed when Philadelphia traded for Jahan Dotson, but the Texas A&M product may have shown enough as both a receiver and a returner to claim the last spot on the wide receiver depth chart. ", " Parris Campbell EaglesWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:27 PM Campbell caught both his targets for 34 yards and returned one kickoff for 18 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:The former Colt and Giant has dealt with a groin strain for most of training camp, but he looked healthy Saturday as he got the start and caught both of Kenny Pickett's longest completions of the day for 19 and 15 yards. Campbell was signed in the offseason to compete for the No. 3 wideout role behind A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, but the Eagles' trade for Jahan Dotson on Thursday likely bumps him one rung further down the depth chart. Campbell's ability to contribute on special teams -- he averaged 30.4 yards per kickoff return in college at Ohio State -- might be what saves his spot on the 53-man roster. ", " Tyrion Davis-Price EaglesRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:21 PM Davis-Price carried the ball 12 times for 56 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:The former 49er handled six straight carries to begin the Eagles' opening drive but fumbled the sixth, marring what was otherwise a solid performance in the team's preseason finale. Davis-Price isn't guaranteed a spot on the season-opening roster with Saquon Barkley, Kenneth Gainwell and Will Shipley all seemingly locked into jobs, but he could provide some injury insurance on the practice squad. ", " Cordarrelle Patterson SteelersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:16 PM Patterson rushed the ball three times for 31 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's 31-24 preseason loss to the Lions. Spin:With Jaylen Warren (hamstring) sidelined, Patterson was the second back on the field behind Najee Harris. Patterson played with both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, but his highlight of the game came on the team's first drive when he ripped through the middle of the field for a 31-yard touchdown scamper. Warren looks likely to be ready for Week 1, but Patterson would likely get passing-down work and some occasional carries if Warren is unable to suit up. . ", " Tanner McKee EaglesQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:15 PM McKee completed 13 of 21 passes for 115 yards and an interception in Saturday's 26-3 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:The 2023 sixth-round pick took over from Kenny Pickett to begin the season half, but McKee failed to lead the Eagles to points on any of his five drives and turned the ball over twice, getting sacked and fumbling the ball on his first snap and then chucking a red-zone interception on his last one. This was the Stanford product's last chance to make his case for the No. 2 quarterback job behind Jalen Hurts, but McKee wouldn't seem to have done enough to overtake Pickett on the depth chart. ", " Zach Evans RamsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:11 PM Evans rushed 14 times for 45 yards and a pair of touchdowns in Saturday's preseason finale against the Texans. Spin:Evans split rushing duties with Boston Scott (leg) as the two had been doing all preseason sans starters. The former separated himself from the veteran in this contest by cashing in both of the Rams' rushing touchdowns on the day. The top three spots on the RB depth chart are firm, but Evans could sneak his way onto the roster ahead of Scott as RB4 if he the 2023 sixth-round pick is not stashed on the practice squad. ", " Kenny Yeboah JetsTE Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:11 PM Yeboah is doubtful to return to Saturday's preseason game against the Giants due to a groin injury, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports. Spin:Yeboah sustained the injury in the first quarter. He hauled in his lone target for three yards before exiting the game. Yeboah is competing for a depth spot at tight end behind starter Tyler Conklin. ", " Kenny Pickett EaglesQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:09 PM Pickett completed six of nine passes for 58 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason loss to the Vikings. Spin:With Jalen Hurts sitting out the Eagles' preseason finale, Pickett got another start and played the entire first half, but the former Steeler did little with the opportunity. Pickett's longest completions both went to Parris Campbell, for 19 and 15 yards on his first and last possessions of the day, but he had no other gains for double-digit yards. 2023 sixth-round pick Tanner McKee played most of the second half and had an uneven performance, which likely secures Pickett's spot as Hurts' primary backup to begin the regular season. ", " Josh Jacobs PackersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 5:05 PM Jacobs (coach's decision) was held out of Saturday's preseason finale against the Ravens. Spin:Jacobs made a brief appearance in Green Bay's first exhibition contest, but the team opted to keep its new offensive weapon fresh ahead of Week 1. The 26-year-old barely reached 1,000 total yards from scrimmage in his final season with the Raiders, but his production was likely diminished due to poor offensive game planning combined with the lack of a legitimate passing offense to keep opposing defenses honest. That shouldn't be the case in Green Bay, as the Jordan Love era appears to be trending in the right direction in conjunction with the star running back's arrival. Jacobs should still be considered an early-round asset in fantasy drafts as the kickoff of the 2024 season nears. ", " Myles Gaskin VikingsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:47 PM Gaskin carried the ball 13 times for 61 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason win over the Eagles. He also caught two of three targets for six yards. Spin:The veteran running back got the start in the Vikings' exhibition finale, which doesn't bode well for his chances of making the 53-man roster, but he had another productive preseason performance. Gaskin might have been auditioning for other teams with Aaron Jones, Ty Chandler and Kene Nwangwu set at the top of the depth chart, but if he does wind up back on Minnesota's practice squad, he seems capable of giving the Vikings reliable snaps if called upon. ", " Tank Dell TexansWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:43 PM Dell (coach's decision) was held out of Saturday's preseason finale against the Rams. Spin:Dell continues to work with the first team offense despite the addition of superstar wideout Stefon Diggs this offseason and continued presence of Nico Collins as the No. 2 option. With C.J. Stroud looking like the real deal under center, the sophomore slot man may be a rare case in today's NFL of a true No. 3 receiver carrying \"must-start\" status in fantasy (a la Wes Welker with the 2007 Patriots). Dell has already proven his good health -- following last year's fractured fibula -- when he broke off a long touchdown catch in the Texans' first preseason contest before sitting out Saturday's exhibition finale. ", " DeWayne McBride VikingsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:31 PM McBride carried the ball 11 times for 34 yards and caught two of three targets for 27 yards in Saturday's 26-3 preseason win over the Eagles. Spin:The 2023 seventh-round pick missed some practice time earlier this week with a minor knee issue, but McBride was healthy for the Vikings' preseason finale and saw action as the second running back into the game after Myles Gaskin. McBride didn't come off the practice squad as a rookie, and with Aaron Jones, Ty Chandler and Kene Nwangwu all locked into roster spots, the UAB product may not get a chance to make his NFL regular-season debut in 2024 either. ", " George Pickens SteelersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:31 PM Pickens recorded two catches on two targets for 26 yards in Saturday's 24-17 preseason loss to the Lions. Spin:Pickens appeared in one drive with Russell Wilson under center and was targeted twice. The latter was an explosive catch as he ran deep across the middle of the field for a 32-yard gain. Pickens is unquestionably the top pass catcher in Pittsburgh and should be set to receive a large number of targets, barring a late addition to the wide receiver corps. ", " Jaren Hall VikingsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:26 PM Hall completed 17 of 25 passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns in Saturday's 26-3 preseason win over the Eagles. He added 11 rushing yards on two carries. Spin:The 2023 fifth-round pick got the start with both Sam Darnold and Nick Mullens getting held out of the Vikings' preseason finale, and Hall played into the third quarter before being replaced under center by Matt Corral. Hall was was impressive, albeit against Philadelphia's second-team defenders, and he led Minnesota to five straight scoring drives to begin the game, hitting Trishton Jackson and Justin Hall for TDs in the red zone. The second-year player appears set as the Vikings' No. 3 quarterback, but even with J.J. McCarthy (knee) lost for the season, Hall is unlikely to see any regular-season action other than in an emergency. ", " Najee Harris SteelersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:21 PM Harris rushed the ball once for five yards in Saturday's 24-17 preseason loss to the Lions. Spin:Harris played on the opening drive with Russell Wilson under center and received his carry on the opening play of the game. He'll likely head into Week 1 as the top choice in Pittsburgh's backfield for early down work, though the team has continuously played down the significance of Jaylen Warren's hamstring injury. If Warren is able to suit up, he would likely cost Harris significant work as a pass catcher as well as some rushing attempts. ", " Cooper Kupp RamsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:20 PM Kupp (coach's decision) was held out of all the Rams' preseason contests this season. Spin:Head coach Sean McVay's gameplan to rest his key players and hide his offensive gameplan allowed Kupp to get some extra rest after two separate lower-body injuries caused the superstar to miss 12 games over the last two years. 2023 Rookie of the Year Puka Nacua (knee) emerged in the veteran's absence, and both players are lined up to start a regular season across from each other for the first time. McVay mentioned earlier in the offseason that Kupp was still limited by the aforementioned leg injuries last season when he provided a 7/59/5 receiving line across 12 games. The 31-year-old is only two years removed from his memorable Super Bowl MVP campaign, so a bounce back could be in store for Kupp's suitors if McVay's words hold water this year. ", " Kyren Williams RamsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 4:03 PM Williams (coach's decision) did not play in any of the Rams' preseason games in 2024. Spin:Head coach Sean McVay held Williams and the rest of the starting unit out of exhibition play this season. The 2023 breakout fantasy star was dealing with a minor foot injury early in training camp, but he does not carry an injury designation heading into Week 1 of the regular season. The underlying concern for Williams' fantasy managers is if rookie third-round pick Blake Corum continues to impress the Rams' coaching staff and cuts into the starter's usage this season. Williams remains the No. 1 option for McVay's fast-paced offense after dropping 1,350 yards from scrimmage and 15 total touchdowns across 12 games last year. ", " Boston Scott RamsRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:49 PM Scott (leg) carried the ball 11 times for 32 yards in Saturday's preseason finale against the Texans. Spin:Scott picked up a leg contusion in last week's exhibition win over the Chargers, but he wound up missing no game time to the minor setback. The veteran backup has rushed for 155 yards on 37 carries in three games this preseason. Scott is looking to make the team as a depth option behind starter Kyren Williams this upcoming season. ", " Justin Fields SteelersQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:33 PM Fields completed three of his four passes for 40 yards in Saturday's 24-17 preseason loss to the Lions. He added two rushes for four yards. Spin:Fields took over the offense after one drive in relief of Russell Wilson. As has been the case for much of preseason and training camp, his performance was a mixed bag. He looked accurate in the middle and short areas of the field and led a scoring drive, but he also took two sacks and had a missed exchange on a snap. Coach Mike Tomlin declined to name a starting quarterback after the game, but usage in the last two weeks suggests that Fields will begin the season as the backup to Wilson. ", " KJ Hamler BillsWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:08 PM Hamler rushed three times for 21 yards and a touchdown while catching all three of his targets for 11 yards in Saturday's 31-26 preseason loss to the Panthers. Spin:Hamler got some reps at running back after Frank Gore (knee) and Darrynton Evans (hamstring) exited Saturday's game, while top three running backs James Cook, Ray Davis and Ty Johnson were resting Saturday. The former Broncos wide receiver filled in admirably, breaking off an 18-yard gain on the ground and running in a one-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. The ability to fill in at running back is another feather in the cap for the versatile Hamler, who also contributes on special teams as a return man. That versatility should help Hamler secure a spot on the 53-man roster ahead of the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Cardinals ", " Dalton Kincaid BillsTE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:06 PM Kincaid didn't see the field in Saturday's 31-26 preseason loss to the Panthers. Spin:Buffalo held key starters like Josh Allen and Kincaid out of the preseason finale to ensure that they're healthy for the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Cardinals. Kincaid put up 673 receiving yards in a promising rookie regular season last year, and he's a likely candidate to pick up some of the slack following the offseason departure of wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who accounted for 1,183 receiving yards on 160 targets in the 2023 regular season. ", " Miles Sanders PanthersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:02 PM Sanders rushed three times for six yards and wasn't targeted in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Sanders checked in for the second drive with the backups after Chuba Hubbard handled three carries with the first-team offense on the opening drive. Hubbard looks like the starter heading into the Sept. 8 season opener in New Orleans, but Sanders is likely to mix in occasionally, at least until rookie second-round pick Jonathon Brooks (knee) is ready to play. Brooks isn't expected to be available until Week 3 at the earliest. ", " Adam Thielen PanthersWR News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 3:01 PM Thielen caught his only target for 21 yards in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Thielen and the rest of the first-team offense played the opening drive, which ended in an eight-yard touchdown catch by Jordan Matthews. Offseason trade acquisition Diontae Johnson and rookie first-round pick Xavier Legette could cut into Thielen's target share in 2024, so matching last year's total of 137 will be tough, but Carolina's entire offense could benefit from increased efficiency if 2023 first overall pick Bryce Young can take a step forward in his second NFL regular season, which kicks off Sept. 8 against the Saints. ", " Stetson Bennett RamsQB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 2:10 PM Bennett will be the Rams' backup quarterback for the first two weeks of the regular season while Jimmy Garoppolo serves his suspension, Stu Jackson of the team's official site reports. Spin:Garoppolo was suspended two games for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances, opening the door for Bennett to serve as the backup to Matthew Stafford to open the regular season. Bennett played in the first two preseason games, but he was held out of the Rams' preseason finale against the Texans on Saturday, with Dresser Winn starting under center for the entire contest. In his last game against the Chargers on Aug. 17, Bennett completed 17 of 31 pass attempts for 213 yards, one touchdown and one interception. ", " Chuba Hubbard PanthersRB News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:43 PM Hubbard rushed three times for 15 yards and wasn't targeted in Saturday's 31-26 preseason win over the Bills. Spin:Hubbard played the opening drive with Carolina's other starters, while Miles Sanders mixed in later with the backups, suggesting that Hubbard occupies the top spot on the depth chart heading into the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Saints. Rookie second-round pick Jonathon Brooks (knee) could challenge for the starting job eventually, but Brooks isn't expected to be available until Week 3 at the earliest. ", " Owen Wright RavensRB Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:40 PM Wright is expected to undergo surgery for a hairline fracture in his foot that he sustained in Saturday's preseason game against the Packers, Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic reports. Spin:The injury isn't considered to be season ending, but Zrebiec notes that the Ravens will now have to make a decision on whether to retain Wright on the roster at the conclusion of training camp. Wright was a strong contender to win the No. 3 running back spot behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill, but now his spot on the Ravens' roster is in jeopardy. With Wright's injury and Keaton Mitchell (knee) still on the active/PUP list, the door has opened for Rasheen Ali and Chris Collier to compete for the third running back spot behind Henry and Hill as training camp winds down. ", " Anthony Schwartz DolphinsWR Doubtful News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 1:00 PM Schwartz suffered a ligament tear in his left knee during Friday's preseason loss to Tampa Bay, Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports. Spin:Schwartz didn't play in either of the Dolphins' first two exhibition contests but was finally able to take the field Friday for the preseason finale. The 23-year-old caught both of his targets for 24 yards, but on his second catch -- a 17-yard reception thrown by Skylar Thompson -- he hurt his knee while being tackled. Jackson cites a source in indicating that Schwartz tore a ligament in his left knee on the play and suggests that the speedy wideout is headed either to IR or toward an injury settlement. Miami has yet to confirm those details, but this nonetheless appears to be another hit to a wide receiver room that has had its depth thinned due to a multitude of injuries. ", " Ihmir Smith-Marsette PanthersWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 12:49 PM Smith-Marsette is questionable to return to Saturday's preseason game against the Bills due to an ankle injury, Darin Gantt of the Panthers' official site reports. Spin:The wide receiver was examined for a possible lower right leg injury after landing awkwardly following a catch, per David Newton of ESPN.com. Smith-Marsette returned a punt for 21 yards and a kickoff for 46 yards before exiting. The 24-year-old is projected to be Carolina's punt returner in 2024. ", " Freddie Swain FAWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 11:31 AM Swain (undisclosed) was let go from injured reserve with an injury settlement Saturday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Spin:The wide receiver now has a chance to play in 2024 if he can catch on with another team. Swain spent the majority of the 2023 season on the Dolphins' practice squad. The 26-year-old caught 42 passes for 576 yards and six touchdowns with Seattle and Denver between 2020 and 2022. ", " Jacob Harris EaglesWR Questionable News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 11:01 AM Harris has a concussion and is out for the rest of the Eagles' preseason game against the Vikings on Saturday. Spin:The wide receiver did not record a catch before exiting. Harris is competing for a depth role beyond Philadelphia's top trio of A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Jahan Dotson. The fourth-year pro has one catch for six yards over three previous NFL seasons. ", " Tommy Sweeney FATE News Archive \t SAT, AUG 24, 10:41 AM Sweeney was cut by the Bears on Saturday. Spin:The tight end was competing for a roster spot behind Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. Sweeney did not see the field in 2023 with the Giants after appearing in 24 games between 2019 and 2022 with the Bills. ", " Brock Purdy 49ersQB News Archive"]}
